              "' When I had been obviously unjustly treated and had no possibility á\\nof elucidating this. When a car is overtaking another and I am forced to drive off the á\\nroad. When one is unjustly accused of something one has not done. Friends who torture animals. When my partner was attacked and lost three teeth. Unjust accusations directed at me and my way of acting, by á\\nsomeone close to me.   When I heard on the radio that the football match in Belgium had á\\nended in a catastrophe, and several people had died.  I could not á\\n understand how normal people could behave in such a way. At my Summer job, nobody looked after me in particular and I had á\\nto learn all on my own. When I spoke to Jan-Erik Wikstr÷m on the telephone.  I locked myself out. At work, when an elderly man complained unjustifiably about me and á\\ndistrusted me. Mad at my dad. When someone stole my bike. When friends try to put me down or hurt me.   When my boyfriend went away for a month long holiday without me. At a restaurant I observed how the gypsies tried to get money by á\\ncheating the foreigners i.e non Swedish speaking.  My anger had á\\nnothing to do with hatred against foreigners, but it was an á\\nexpression of the anger I feel when I see people being used . When I got caught in the pouring rain last Thursday and did not á\\nhave a raincoat on me. When a colleague asked me for help at work, despite the fact á\\nthat he had more time to do it than I had. The editor changed the heading of an article that I had written.  á\\nHe considered the heading to be derogatory towards the person I had written á\\nabout. On the T.V I saw a news feature on South Africa.  A policeman      á\\nattacked a group of black people with a whip. We were starting a student project, and the teacher we talked to á\\nwas very negative and not very helpful. Being treated unfairly. I was accused of having done something, which I hadn\\'t and got á\\nvery angry. I went to a lecture and once again it had been cancelled, this á\\nwas the second time.  One had a negative attitude towards the á\\nlecturer.á\\n In the holiday cottage of our association, two of my pals came to á\\nwake me up early one morning by bringing a radio played at the á\\nhighest volume into my room - it was the morning service at its á\\nloudest. We were in a disco and the evening was not at all pleasant.  á\\nDespite my not knowing why, I was angry with my companion.  I let á\\nhim feel my bad humour as I cannot hide my feelings. [ I sometimes quarrel with my mother because she blames me, á\\nthough I have not in any way been connected to some events.] Two boys whom I know were telling me, in an indecent manner, how á\\nthey had teased a young and shy girl I know.  They had despised á\\nher conviction, scorned and touched her.  I got very angry and á\\ndid not try to conceal it and gave it back to them. When my tennis match was interrupted because a kid cycled right á\\ninto the court. I had a very heavy work load and two colleagues, whom I have á\\nnothing against, disturbed me by \"terror ringing\", i.e á\\ncontinously interrupting me by telephoning. When I was deputy manager during the Summer, certain deputies á\\ntook liberties, more than what was normal. I reached the bus stop and realized that I had forgotten my bus á\\npass. When someone does something wrong which affects me negatively. I saw a report on T.V news on apartheid in South Africa.  The time when someone let the air out of the tyres of my cycle. [ No response.] When I missed the tram after having run for it. When I am accused of something I have not done, I get unbelievably á\\nangry. Someone drove into my car and then denied that it had happened. Quarrel in the family. My car had been towed away by the traffic police because it had á\\nbeen wrongly parked.  However the sign had been put up only after á\\nI had already parked. A colleague asked me for some advice and as he did not have á\\nenough confidence in me he asked a third person. When close relatives tried to dissuade me from studying á\\nPsychology because of its low status. My employer took too many aspirins for a bad back and also drank á\\nan enormous amount of spirit.  This was dangerous  and he did á\\nnot understand that he had done anything wrong. The sports fishermen who catch gulls instead of fish with their hooks. á\\n  It is often a mistake but it makes me angry. When I found out that the guy I was dating at a particular time á\\nhad a steady relationship going on with someone else for a long á\\ntime. When, after a week at school, a teacher sent a note home saying á\\nthat my son was inattentive and unable to do his lessons. When I was pointed out as a problem child in primary school and á\\nmy mother took the teacher\\'s point of view. When my parents drove me to a nearby place and went home á\\nimmediately instead of waiting a few hours.  They could have á\\neasily waited. When we were in high school a few guys sometimes provoked a á\\nfriend of mine.  They called her a pig and then grunted.  This á\\nirritated most of the girls.  Once, one of the girls got angry at á\\nmy friend and said something nasty and this made me terribly á\\nangry. When my boyfriend sat up half the night playing computer games á\\nwith a friend. When my mother interfered in my life. When my father asked me if I was a communist, at the same time he á\\nmade it clear that I should no longer see myself as his daughter. When my boss enrolled in a course to satisfy his own ends - to á\\ntrample on his associates.  I have the misfortune to have one of á\\nmy superiors in my course. When my friend, as usual, forgot the tickets at home for a á\\nperformance.  We missed it. When I tried to explain to a plumber, face to face, that the á\\ntoilet was broken and he did not believe it (it had been mended á\\nten times). When I read about Reagan\\'s tactical decision concerning the á\\nSouth African boycott. Some noisy guests arrived at the hotel.  I had been slightly á\\nirritated earlier.  At night when I was trying to sleep they were á\\nhaving a party so I went and yelled at them.  I wanted to sleep á\\nas I had to get up early the next day. Recently when my sister, who is four years younger than me and á\\nvery spoiled, shouted at my mother for no apparent reason .  The á\\nheart-broken expression on my mother\\'s face made me feel very á\\nangry. On the way home from Marstrand I was driving behind my father\\'s á\\ncar.  Another car tried to push in front of my father and he was á\\nforced to swerve and he thus collided the car with a pillar.  The á\\nother car drove off without even seeing what had happened.

In the song á\\nabout me, there were things which irritated me a lot.

This is when only a fractoin of the students á\\ncan find an appartment. While playing a ball game, I was just about to make a goal when I á\\nwas thrown off my feet, and I failed to score the goal.

I wanted to see a friend, I had been looking forward to it and á\\nhad certain expectations, but he did not pay any attention to me, á\\nplayed cards with other people. Recently a good friend only called me when he needed something. á\\nHe never said \"please\" or \"thank you\" or any other kind word. When I lost my driving license because I had been driving while á\\nunder the influence of alcool. A colleague asked me to study with her. I could not explain á\\nthings as perfectly as she had expected. So she reacted in an á\\naggressive manner. When we rearranged furniture in our flat and got stuck in a á\\nchair.

It was a quarter of an á\\nhour before the appointed time, I had just lied down and did not á\\nwant to go because it was too late anyway. She said that I only á\\nwas talking about looking for work, but if it was possible I á\\nwould not accept it. I was angry about this unjust judgment. A friend called me and told me that she wanted to come and see á\\nme. She lived in a village at 50 km distance fom my home town. á\\nNext morning I expected her but she didn\\'t arrive.

I wanted to clear up a misunderstanding with a friend that I had á\\ncaused. A third person meddled in our conversation, turned my á\\nefforts to ridicule so that I did not succeed in what I had á\\nintended. I went singing with a group of young people on January 6th (The á\\nthree Magi), a local custom called \"star singing\". One of the girls, my á\\ngirlfriend, broke the star. Being the accompanying person, I felt very á\\nangry thinking of the consequences. During a lecture, a colleague who did not know anything about the á\\nsubject, got on my nerves asking silly questions. During the Christmas holdidays I wanted to invite my brother, his á\\ngirlfriend and their child for dinner.

After an exhausting day I came home and wanted to take a bath to á\\nrelax. My father wanted to take a bath first and when he had á\\nfinished after an hour, there was no hot water left for me. My mother treated me unjustly as if I was a little child. I said á\\nmean things. I was unable to defend myself adequately. It happened in a tram: some older people started to grumble about á\\nthe young people just because I had not immediately left my seat á\\nto them. At the end of my holiday job I got less money than was due to me á\\nand nobody mentioned anything about that. I share my small flat with my friend.

I was angry about several drivers who showed an aggressive and á\\ndangerous driving habit. When I was house-hunting: Another person got a flat that I would á\\nhave liked, too, because he heaped a floot of words on the á\\nletter. When I wanted to talk to someone I liked and whom I have been á\\ntold likes me (by his brother and even by himself) however he á\\navoids any confrontation, and is vague. My feelings towards would-be in-laws for their participation in á\\nrecent broken relationship. When boyfriend lied to me. People hunting animals.

When I felt being treated unjustly by a teacher. A friend was unpunctual, we wanted to prepare ourselves for an á\\nexamination. When we still attended school, my brother and I usually went to á\\nsee our aunt and to show her our term\\'s report. She rewarded us á\\nwith money. Although my reports were as good as my brother\\'s, he á\\ngot more money. I had stolen a bottle of rum from a person who knows me well. He á\\nthreatened to call the police if I did not pay 500 Shillings. I had arranged with a friend to go with him to Carinthia by car. á\\nWe had arranged a place where to meet. I was a bit late and my á\\nfriend had left already. I had no money to go by train. I nearly á\\nstarted to cry because I was so angry - it was very important for á\\nme to go to Carinthia. At an examination I got a bad mark just because of a small á\\nmistake. When I went to the lector and wanted to talk about that, á\\nhe did not listen to me but sent me away. When I am discussing something with a person and I realize that á\\nthe other person is thinking over her own argumentations instead á\\nof listening, I become angry.

At a school dance when my supposed \"best friend\" kept walking á\\naway from me whenever I came near her. A person ignored my advice, did not pay any attention to what was á\\nsaying. She acted as though I wasn\\'t even there. We were doing á\\ngroup work so everybody had the right to speak yet she just á\\nignored me. She made me feel insignificant. At the hardware store, trying to convert Imperial to Metric á\\nmeasurements, I made a mistake, and didn\\'t buy enough tiles for á\\nthe bathroom. I was angry at myself, because I hope to be a Maths á\\nteacher. Going away for the weekend, leaving my College room open - when I á\\nreturned several friends had had a party there, leaving the mess. When I received the mark well above requirements for the course I á\\nwanted to enter, yet I was not accepted - anger at the injustice á\\nof it, because I didn\\'t receive early release of H.S.C. marks. In a situation whereby a friend\\'s actions were deliberately á\\nagainst my wishes and (with) no regard to my feelings. When a friend wouldn\\'t speak to me and wouldn\\'t tell me why. When I was accused of \"bitching\" about best friend. When I was put into a tennis team below my standard. When my sister lost my favourite jumper at a party and failed to á\\ntell me for several days after it happened. While at school I had to write an essay for doing something wrong á\\nthat I didn\\'t do. I wrote the essay about how I was mistreated and á\\ngot Saturday morning detention along with a few other kids, but á\\nthey didn\\'t show up. Getting terrible meals, but paying heaps for them. My younger brother and I had been fighting over the TV/Video. He á\\nkept on turning it on and off every 2 seconds and was not á\\nlistening to my authority and was being cheeky. We fought and I á\\nended up in tears - he\\'d won. Can\\'t remember exact example. When I was left by the person I loved without any reason. I feel it when I see that somebody is traying to made a stupid of á\\nme. I was with my girlfriend when some guys that I don\\'t like made á\\nfuss at my girl. When an unknown person provoked me verbaly and physically. I learned that my girlfriend had been unjustly missed from work. I was indignant at the unimpartiality shown by the referees at á\\nthe football match between Bulgaria and France. When I talk to silly, petty-minded and unmanageable people. My grandfather\\'s funeral. An unjust calumny concerning me. With self at losing an important game that I should have won. I was angry at a University tutorial when an ignorant loudmouth á\\npersisted in trying to dominate the conversation. As a child - about 8 years old - walking across a paddock - being á\\nset upon by another boy who claimed it was \"his land\" - being á\\nintimidated by the boy - crying, being punched, etc. I was informed by my flatmate that, when we\\'d moved into our á\\nflat, she\\'d expected us to buy our food separetely - this event á\\nactually happened some 5 months after our sharing began. Prior to á\\nthis, she had said nothing. When my brothers were being cruel to my boyfriend, because his á\\nflat-mate bent back one of my brother\\'s fingers. It wasn\\'t his á\\nfault. My flatmate was asking questions about my relationship with my á\\nboyfriend, whether I wasn\\'t treating him as unfairly as I claimed á\\nhe\\'d been treating me. As a result, I was angered, and became á\\ndefensive. Anger at doctors for their treatment of me after giving birth. á\\nThey left part of placenta behind and I bled heavily for twelve á\\nweeks - due to this, I felt weak and emotional, and they said I á\\nneeded psychiatric treatment and give me no support. My ex-boyfriend began to date my best friend. After they had been á\\nseeing each other, I found out that he had been sleeping with á\\nanother girl, without my friend knowing, I told my friend what he á\\nhad been doing behind her back. After seeing an \"uncertain\" child work on a model for several á\\nhours, I watched a \"bully\" of the same age destroy it, telling á\\nthe child that it was worthless. When a so-called friend let me down, when she promised to tell me á\\nwhen a certain concert was occurring, and that she\\'d get me á\\ntickets. I was really looking forward to it. She did nothing, á\\njust told me out of the blue one day what a fantastic concert it á\\nwas going to be. One day in a crossroad somebody crashed my car. I got out and á\\nthis person laughed at me. I felt such a great anger that I got á\\nin my car and went away. When one teacher unjustly gave me zero in a test saying that I á\\nwas cribbing. I went to the school library and asked for a book, but the á\\nlibrarian told me that there wasn\\'t such. However when an other á\\ncolleague asked for it she gave it to him. I feel anger when somebody forbids me to do something. When they changed my office to another room without my agreement. This feeling occurred to me when my colleague entered in G.V. á\\n(University) and I didn\\'t. I felt anger when I had a fight with my father, and he beated me. á\\nMy mother came to help me (because I was beeing beated) and he á\\nalso beated my mother. I feel anger when things don\\'t come out as I wish. When they denied a job to a person that I propsed giving political á\\nreasons that has nothing to do directly with the professional á\\nlevel. When they stole my dark blue tennis. I felt anger of a friend when she met \"a date\" and become nervous á\\nand pest as she always gets when she meets him. I\\'m crazy about football. When my team lost a goal in the Paulist á\\nchampionship, and so it lost the classifications. About the car (sadness) I felt anger the way I acted after á\\nnegotiating it. Nearby the end of the year my wife and I were having a car ride, á\\nwhen it appears another vehicle, driven by a drunk driver and á\\nprovokes an accident. The fact that I hadn\\'t been informed about something and I had the á\\ngreatest trust in this person. When I used to go to my chief asking about any doubt about the job á\\nand he didn\\'t care, didn\\'t answer me, leaving me speaking alone. When a person is privileged in account of situations that are á\\nunjust, and disloyal to colleagues and friends. Once in my work it happened a fight between the person in charge and me. I á\\ngot so angry and spoke out everything I felt at the moment. When my boss cut off my vacations saying that in that month it á\\nwouldn\\'t be possible, and after some time he let another girl á\\ntake vacations that month. The anger was because of the á\\nresentment. Resulting from our bad relationship. When my mother slapped me in the face, I felt anger at that á\\nmoment. When I was robbed in a bus. One day I lent my tennis I just had washed to my sister because á\\nshe asked it. I asked her not to soil it as I had just washed it. á\\nNext day I looked at the tennis, and it was dirty with wax. She á\\ncould not have soiled it. It was lack of consideration. I felt á\\nvery angry. In certain occasion I have a fight with my boyfriend. During the á\\nfight I closed the door at his face. He went away but came back á\\nnext day. My mother in law slept in my bed. In the last year of the high school we had a huge fight between á\\nmy group and the graduation commission (two students of my á\\nclassroom) because they accused us unjustly of a gossip about á\\nthem. When a boy tried to fool me so he would be OK trying to show me á\\nthat he is a gook boy. I loved a person and he went away. It wasn\\'t necessary that he á\\nleft me to reach his goals. My mother was ill and asked me to prpare our lunch. I went to do it, á\\nand while I was working, she stayed behind me telling what I á\\nhad, or not to do. I asked her to stop meddling, and to go to á\\nbed. When I went to ask for help to my sister, my mother said that á\\nI was proud, that I asked for help only when I wanted and that I á\\nwasn\\'t able to cook by myself. A girl entered in the division where I work and greeted everybody á\\nbut not me. When my chief accused me of an error that I hadn\\'t made. I don\\'t use to lie to my parets about what I do, and the two á\\ntimes that I felt anger were when they doubted me I said that I á\\nwas going to the club, and they didn\\'t believe me because the day á\\nbefore they had met me at FLIPERAMA. I had the wish to kill them. When I was misleaded by a person who assured that something would á\\nnot occur, that I had no reason to prepccupy myself, and suddenly á\\nI saw myself implicated by the fact, because of the incompetence, á\\nand irresponsibility of that person. I felt anger when I saw that I was being misleaded by my á\\nboyfriend, he went out with other girls. I felt anger for his á\\nfalsity. When my sister took something that belonged to me without my á\\npermission. When I realized that the person I was courting hadn\\'t been really á\\nby my side for a long time already. He had deceived me and I let á\\nhim deceive me. I felt much anger and perhaps I feel it till now, against my á\\ngirlfriend\\'s sister who incited her to betray me just when I á\\nneeded her very much. She didn\\'t think of anything, simply á\\npassed over everything. Without the employer\\'s knowledge and even without any á\\ncommunication their bank accounts were changed and their personal á\\naccounts closed. A ex-boyfriend tried to prejudice me before my fiancT and his á\\nfamily saying things about me that let his family worried. We had á\\nto postpone our wedding and we were already using our wedding á\\nrings. To be honest I didn\\'t feel just anger, I felt hate. When my brother went out with my new shirt that I adored, and á\\nreturned it dirty with grease. My grandmother is a highly authoritative person, who lives alone, á\\nis independent, but doesn\\'t know to live without commanding the á\\nothers. I hate this! When I had a serious argument with a dear person. Discussion with my mother about the way to educate my children. I á\\nfelt anger against my mother. And she said absurd things, false things that filled my ears and á\\ninflated my head which seemed to be caught in a carcass where the á\\nheart wanted to explode and where the arm wanted to knock down á\\nthe world. I felt much anger when my fahter interferred in my relations with á\\nanother person whom I liked very much, ending something that I á\\nadored. When a colleague was rude with me because she didn\\'t understand á\\nthe subject about which I was discussing. I felt anger against a person who told bad things about me in my á\\nabsence. I was on a farm with a few friends and during the talk I á\\ndiscovered that a friend of mine, was being betrayed by her á\\nboyfriend and a 3rd friend of ours. When I left after the examination to enter the University, and á\\neven though I had studied the whole year I made a bad exam.  In the University we were convoked to a stroll like a freshman I á\\nwas still innocent about the manipulation. On seeing the goal of á\\nthe exaltation to poor character people, I felt anger on feeling á\\nmyself mass of maneuver. Discussing with a certain person about a job I was getting and á\\nthat perosn was negative and pessimistic. I was waiting to receive the participation on the profits and did á\\nnot receive it. Once, during a performance I did not sing the way I had to. I was angry when my abilities of a singer were underestimated. At a certain situation I felt myself neglected and undeservedly á\\nharmed. I feel anger when I see a \"parent\" beating and punishing his child á\\nin the street. Recently I was a withness of a similar case. My brother accused me undeservedly before my parents. I was not á\\nguilty. He was misled by his wife. Someone stole my ski at Vitosha and of course I was the one to be á\\nblamed. I left them without supervision. A shop-assistant behaved rather roughly with me though she hadn\\'t á\\nthe slightest grounds for it. When my mother decided to clean out my room and throw out what á\\nshe thought was junk, without my knowing about it, so I returned á\\nhome to find half my stuff gone. When playing a football match, there was one player who made mean á\\ntackels, kicked at everything and did things having nothing to do á\\nwith football. I felt anger against a colleague of mine during a rehearsal in á\\nacting. He hadn\\'t learnt the text of an opera act in the course of á\\nseveral months and thus making difficulties for the rest of my á\\ncolleagues. I felt it on the same occasion when I felt sadness which finally á\\ngrew into anger. I had an accident with a trafic police car that was packed at a á\\ncurve without any visibility and against all traffic regulations á\\nin a strong snowstorm. As a result I still cannot repair my car á\\nbecause of the missing spare parts. A whole crowd of us went to a folklore festival. The instructor á\\nof the cast where my boyfriend played was traveling with us. We á\\ndecided to catch the train that leaved early in the morning á\\nbecause we had business on the following day. The instructor á\\ntried to get the upper hand and made us catch the train in spite á\\nof everything, all the time he made me angry. When my friend (girl) promised to help me go to the hospital and be á\\nexamined by good experts and she deceived me. When you are unjustly assessed at something you are sure to have á\\nbeen right. They wanted something to happen but I didn\\'t. I shared a secret with a friend and it later turned out that he á\\nhad revealed it to another person with whom I didn\\'t get along very well. I get angry with people who attain certain status without á\\ndeserving it, only with the support, authority and influence of á\\nother people. I experience that feeling when I am unsulted without deserving á\\nit or when someone deceives me. I get angry when someone imputes on me things I never can do, á\\nnaturally negative. Servility, \"connections\", impudence, traits á\\nthat get me mad. I have a friend that I deeply trusted but it happened that I lost á\\nmy confidence in her for which she herself was to blame. When I was a soldier I quarrelled with my commander and may be in á\\nrevenge for this he detailed me on duty two successive nights. á\\nNaturally he checked me up on the second night and found me á\\nasleep for which he sent me to the cells. Teenage neighbours smashed my letterbox for the fifth time in a á\\ncouple of months. It was a deliberate action of kids who had á\\nstayed in my home, had meals there yet took a dislike to my á\\ndaughter.  I\\'ve a situation of responsibility an employee who had a habit of á\\nbeing late, came late again after promising to say he would be at á\\nwork in a few minutes, then arrived 3 hours later. He had been á\\ndrinking. A friend got angry and drove \"like a lunatic\" with me and others á\\nin his car. I was angry about his dangerous driving. In the house where I live there is a new flatmate. His friends á\\nunfortunately are the dirt of society, intelligent, fashonable, á\\nrich and bored. At a party recently they were doing things I á\\ndidn\\'t like done in my house. I felt angry at them. When, for example, I was not approved to continue my studies at á\\nthe Moscow University, no matter that I had the highest marks and á\\nin general the best records of all the candidates. I haven\\'t often felt this feeling. Once someone stole my garment. Attitude to some manners of dealing and some \"sanctioned\" á\\nrelations. A close person lied to me. Unjust punishment of a friend of mine. At an unjust, or to be more precise, at a bureaucratic treatment á\\nof one\\'s personality. Anger I felt when my boyfriend told me he didn\\'t mind breaking it á\\noff with me, i.e. each of us to take his own road. Because until á\\nthat moment, he deliberately restricted our dates. The motives á\\nwere brought to my knowledge later. In a conversation my boyfriend expressed definite and quite á\\npretentious opinions and he took up an attitude towards a theory á\\nwhich he himself had never known. His information was from á\\nfortuitous sources. I feel this feeling when I am to fill in a questionnaire or a á\\nform. Unfair and unjust attitude toward a person close to me, what I á\\nwas the witness of, caused anger in me. The doctors from Belogradchik town determined a wrong diagnosis á\\nto my son. A month later, after some complex examinations at ISUL á\\n(A medical institute in Sofia), the diagnosis was categorically rejected. When I see how people around me pass by certain unjustice because á\\nof indifference or cowardice. When someone lies to me. It was quite recently, at the football match between the national á\\nteams of Bulgaria and France. I felt strong anger with the Scottish á\\nreferee who ran the match quite partially. A friend of mine promised to come with me to the cinema but he á\\ndidn\\'t come. I was neglected undeservedly. About a month ago the Regional Council refused to pay my wife the á\\ndue maternity benefit, because of bureaucratic reasons. When I encountered not only with my father\\'s lack of á\\nunderstanding but also with his unwillingness to understand me as á\\na parent, as far as things for which I (not he) have proves to be á\\nright are concerned. I thought him a good friend but he tried to lie to me several times. á\\nLast time was the height of impudence. He promised he would come á\\nhome but he didn\\'t. I felt a sense of anger and insult. At an undeserved attitude toward a man, when human personality is á\\nnot treated decently. I feel a strong anger when I am treated unjustly. My husband and I were invited at the house of our nieghbours then á\\nwe got an invitation on the part of my parents which we had to á\\nrefuse. A a result they called me by words that provoked my á\\nanger. A honest \"sliding\" on the part of a girlfriend of mine. á\\nTerribly crossed I started breaking things and tearing books. I was drawn up a statement for an infringement of the traffic á\\nordinance. In fact I was innocent. When I am made to do things in which I see no sense and I waste á\\nmy time. Some time ago I had to participate in a sociological á\\ninvestigation and then I got really angry. I unfairly got a low mark on an exam and I failed to win a grant, á\\nsince then I don\\'t have much confidence in myself at an exam. I get angry when my smaller brother misbehaves and talks with indecent á\\nwords. I got angry with a stranger in a train who behaved impertinently á\\nand immorally I always get angry when somebody deceives me, or tries to conceal á\\nhis lie skilfully and this offends me even more. With the girl whom I may be loved truly. When she refused to come á\\nwith me to an occasion (she was from another town). I felt it when a girl who was dear to me lied to my face. I got á\\nangry with the fact that she knew I didn\\'t believe her but she á\\nkept on telling lies. When my husband stays late at a meeting and I have to be alone. I got angry when I learned how short a time we had to prepare for á\\nthe term examinations. A chief was unjustly punished on an autumn brigade and the one á\\nwho was really guilty kept silent. I stepped in front and told á\\nthe truth. The guilty chief called me in after the roll-call and á\\nthreatened me. My grandmother\\'s brother had taken active part in the resistance á\\nmovement. He had been in prison many times and there he lost his á\\nhealth. He became an invalid. When we phoned to First Aid the á\\nnurse on duty behaved quite unkindly when she understood how old á\\nhe was (79). I suffered from a gynaecological illness. I was quite displeased á\\nto hear that my roommates had talked about it and they had á\\nmisrepresented the truth. I felt deeply hurt when I learned that á\\nit was done by a \"good\" acquaintance of mine. I confronted with this feeling at the Institute quite recently, á\\nthe pedology lecturer was the cause. When on a car journey a fellow student crossed our way with his á\\nown car and we had to bump into a roadside trunk. I feel angry at people\\'s indifference at our ability to be á\\npresent at an event and to stay partial to what happens. It was necessary to organise a competition in connection with a á\\ncelebration. Everyone was to be present at that event. It turned á\\nout that there was no audience at all because everyone had á\\npretended to be very intelligent and no one had come. I got á\\nfurious. When my bosom friend tried to lie to me. I felt anger at my last exam, I felt angry with our teacher, á\\nbecause he did not rate me objectively and I failed. I felt angry when I failed in an exam about which I knew quite a á\\nfew things and I did not deserve to be plucked. That was what I felt with a teacher who put down quite unreal á\\nmarks. I faced this feeling when I realized I wasn\\'t admitted to the á\\ninstitute in the first classifying, in spite of the high mark I á\\nhad got at the entrance examination.á\\n A nuisance used to live in our flat a month ago. I experienced á\\nthis feeling when I tried to chase her out. I took part in a football match. The referee was extremely á\\npartial to the opposite team. This stirred up my discontent and á\\nanger. When a teacher though pretending to be a highly cultivated á\\nteacher and a man, slapped a classmate of mine in the face quite á\\nundeservedly. The breakup of a relationship. After the event I was upset/sad á\\nthen angry maybe 2/3 weeks later. When my son omits to carry out certain duties at home that he á\\nknows needs doing. In a sociology class I felt very angry towards some members of á\\nsociety for exploiting the Polynesian people, dawn raids by á\\nPolice (Martin Luther King, Blacks in S.A.). But this was just a á\\nreflection of my own shortcomings. A friend visited and made comments that my house/garden were not á\\nas neat/tidy as in the past. I\\'d not seen her a year - She á\\nimplied I\\'d gone to the pack (I\\'d only been working full time, á\\nand taking 3 University exams part time). A shop in Downtown wouldn\\'t accept my Visa Card - before December á\\nlast year. When my husband got picked up in our new car for drunken driving. á\\nWe had made a pact the other would not drink and so therefore á\\nwould be the driver for the evening etc. I was not present at the á\\ntime. My partner without discussing with me the situation decided it á\\nwas time for us to have a break and went ahead and arranged his á\\nown life for the next 6-12 months, then told me the day before it á\\nwas about to happen having been tolerant and friendly for the á\\npreceding week. This situation keeps occurring - when my little sister disagrees á\\nwith me or vice-versa. We have very similar temperaments and I á\\nalways end up feeling angry at her and myself for fighting so á\\nmuch over unimportant trivial matters. Because I am the Captain of a basketball team I usually organise á\\na roster system so that everyone in the team can have a turn at á\\ndoing either a duty or a ref. A lot of the time the girls can\\'t á\\nbe bothered or just forget - I usually have to fill in. When my boyfriend wouldn\\'t dance with me on my graduation night á\\nbecause he thought I could dance with my friends who were á\\nfriendly. Never really had the experience just yet - N/A. When present boyfriend\\'s mother approached my parents and self - á\\nto leave her son alone - as she did not want me for a future á\\ndaughter-in-law. (1) My father died. (2) My natural father contacted me a year á\\nafter my father died and this angered me more as I thought he á\\nshould be dead and not my father. When a man, a stranger to me, personally insulted a close woman á\\nfriend of mine in public. My anger is with men, their inability to be human (not all men). Someone in my family (my brother I suspected) ate a bun which I á\\nhad made for myself. It was during a long telephone call after I á\\nhad just made it and put it in the oven warming drawer. I live by myself and a few weeks ago was woke by a man on the end á\\nof my bed coming up my bed at me. I was really angry, told him to á\\nget out. He was surprised, hesitated; I started to move towards á\\nhim and he backed off - kept telling him - loudly, but firmly to á\\ngo. Because I\\'d got the initiative, I succeeded. A very powerful á\\nmessage. When during a social evening with my father, brother, sister, á\\nclose friend and my father\\'s 2nd wife - I had an argument with my á\\nfather, who abused my friend who was sticking up for me. That a friend had been badly beaten and stabbed many times and á\\nthe person that did it got away without any punishment from the á\\nlaw. When bicycling along, a courier van started to tail me very close á\\n- I sped up and moved over and he just did the same. I reacted á\\nviolently, much physical responding in the dangerous situation. Deliberately provoked by someone close. Angered by the á\\ndeliberation not the provocation. When a close friend failed to live up to the expectations I had á\\nof him - thereby causing pain to his spouse. I believe that my á\\nanger was probably a reaction of fear that I wouldn\\'t be able to á\\nlive up to my own expectations. Landlord putting up rents sneakly and slimily. I was playing in a football tournament and saw the rules openly á\\ndisregarded. My sister and I were fighting as usual. She\\'s older tham I am, á\\nbigger built and stronger I couldn\\'t win in a physical battle and á\\nin a verbal battle I couldn\\'t seem to get through to her to á\\nreally hurt her. At school teacher for not allowing us to go out on New Year\\'s Eve á\\nwhen on a class trip overseas. Once a person in authority (school teacher) was telling blatant á\\nlies about me and the headmistress would not let me defend á\\nmyself. She was also telling lies about other members of my á\\nfamily. I visited a special education school. The headmaster applied a á\\npolicy of strict positive - negative reinforcement to the á\\nchildren involved. Children who measured up to his standards were á\\nmade a fuss of - children who didn\\'t were ignored. At work being shifted to another area. Someone who was speeding was forced to slow down when I pulled á\\nout onto the road and proceeded to abuse me at the next set of á\\ntraffic lights. Arriving home from work after a long and tiring day to find no á\\ndinner prepared as I had expected. Friend (male) hinted that my talking to other men at a pub was á\\nimmoral. He implied that I should remain only with my boyfriend á\\nthe entire evening. When the bus driver failed to stop and pick me up at a bus stop. My boyfriend promised to take me to see a game of tennis and rang á\\nsaying he was going to the pub with some of his friends instead. In a hurry to get to lectures and the car would not start. When fired unjustly from a job as casual bar-person. Charged with á\\ngiving away free drinks. Not done so and had witnesses to prove á\\nit - both patrons and bar staff. Other staff were supportive. Towards wife\\'s laziness in not performing her usual duties á\\nbecause of television watching. NO RESPONSE. My parents didn\\'t allow me to go to a social function that all my á\\nfriends were attending. In arguments with a close friend or relative where my point of á\\nview is completely disregarded. When at very short notice I agreed to work in place of a friend á\\nwho was sick, and owner of the restaurant refused to allow me a á\\ndrink later in the evening (which is usually always available for á\\nworkers), did not thank me, and was generally indifferent towards á\\nme - I felt I did not deserve this. I \"cooked\" the engine in my father\\'s car - it was actually his á\\nfault because he hadn\\'t fixed the temperature gauge or told me. á\\nWhen I finally got home I was absolutely screamed at and the á\\nanger I experienced was over the injustice of it all plus the á\\nhuge row which developed. My best friend at school told lies about me to a boy I was seeing á\\nand went out with him herself. When someone ignores what I am saying or doesn\\'t let me have my á\\npoint of view and they monopolise a conversation. As in sadness (A), relating to this slaghter of fur-seals. Stopped at a Fast Food shop with friends and a few locals wanted á\\nto fight us for no apparent reason. They hit and picked on one of á\\nmy friends. Came back from surfing to find car broken into and gear and money á\\nstolen. I am one of four directors of a company. We inherited land held á\\nby our family - ours is the 5th generation. A \"democratic\" á\\ndecision was made to stap-bank an area of mangroves. Brother continually interupting while I was talking on the á\\ntelephone. When my girlfriend of two years told me it was all over. When my flatmate put me down because she \"thought\" she was better á\\nthan me, or she felt she was. I lent a text-book to a person I did not know very well, they á\\nlost the text-book and gave me no compensation. When my mother rejected my boyfriend and made unfair judgements á\\non him. Most recently when the chairman at the New Zeeland Rugby Union á\\nannounced that the All Blacks\\' would accept the invitation of á\\nSouth Africa to play rugby in that country. In a discussion the leader wanted to stop because she was of the á\\nopinion that we were not involved and she misjudged our reactions á\\nas negative. We however only posed several questions which she á\\ncouldn\\'t answer. A man kept a seat taken by putting his coat on it after a while á\\nthe chair was still empty, I asked him if I could use the chair, á\\nhe didn\\'t agree for the chair was for his coat. The landlord had selected a new lodger on her own, while we used á\\nto do that it was not what she had done, but how she did it that á\\nmade me angry. When someone accuses me without reason and is not willing to á\\nlisten to me. A good friend deceived me. Because of that little quarrel our á\\nrelationship finished, mainly because she was not honest. I was á\\nvery angry about that. When my mother told things to my sister, which I told my mother á\\nin confindence. I had to unscrew something on my car. I didn\\'t succeed after two á\\nafternoons of trying. A feeling of anger built up itself. I had an appointment with someone at a certain time. The other á\\nperson didn\\'t appear. When my friends left without waiting for me, after we had arranged á\\nto go out together. At having an argument with a stranger, in the street. One day, when I was a child, my grandmother shut me up in a room. An argument among friends in which my opinions on the way to á\\nspend spare time were disapproved. When the Real Madrid football team lost against the inter in the á\\nU.E.F.A cup. We lived with 3 persons in the loft of a house. It often occurred á\\nthat other persons again and again climbed the stairs with much á\\nnoise. When I was studying I couldn\\'t concentrate and got angry. My sister borrowed some LP records for a party. She had left them á\\nin the car on curatao. Due to the heat they were crooked, so I á\\ncouldn\\'t play them again. If they force me to eat something I don\\'t like. For example, my á\\nparents always twaddle and whine, when I don\\'t eat all the food.

A time when, as part of my work, I was sent out actually sort of á\\nvolunteered to run an errand for someone who had no authority to á\\nsend me out and the address was very far especially on foot and á\\nturned out to be incorrect too.

Yesterday, á\\nNovember 14. Sometimes when I go to work my crazy boss (a hyper Jewish lawyer) á\\ninsists I do things his way (filing, typing, etc.).

I was to meet a friend at the bus-stop (he was coming to visit á\\nus) and he did not turn up.  After having waited for him for some time     á\\n(about an hour) I called him up, to be told that he did not á\\nintend to come as he was feeling tired.

During the outing they á\\nkept talking to each other and I felt left out, even when I tried á\\nto talk to them they seemed not to listen to me and did not pay á\\nme much attention. I am separated from my husband.  The way he has behaved towards á\\nme makes me angry.

When I did á\\ngo, they thought that I had been selfish and irresponsible duringá\\ntheir illness. Uncleaniness at my work place.

But he did not turn up and á\\nI felt very angry at him. I was very angry one day when my husband ignored me and slept      á\\non a separate bed.

[ This emotion has never been an intense one, that makes it á\\ndifficult to recall it.] I experience this emotion quite often but the day I was most á\\nangry was the day I got pulled up for something I had not done.  á\\nIt happened during my school days, I had not spoken a word in á\\nclass but the monitor had written my name on the board.  So I á\\nhad a remark in my callender which I had to get signed by my á\\nparents.  This remark resulted in me being spanked. A new gas connection was to be installed and the mechanic who came á\\nto do it was very rude to my mother and me.

The mechanic was asked to apologize. When I saw a few people beating a man who seemed to be a á\\nstranger. Despite our good performance and excellent results the management á\\nrefused to meet our demands. One day my elder brother badly scolded my father.

I have á\\nthis feeling whenever someone is not disciplined and methodic in á\\ndoing his duty. I was travelling from Delhi to Bombay.  I had booked a seat one á\\nmonth back and I had also got a telegram confirming this.  á\\nHowever, in the train my name had been omitted from the á\\nreservation sheet, and the one seat that was still vacant was á\\nalloted to another person who paid for it despite my requests for the á\\nseat.  I was allowed to stay in the reserved compartment when I á\\npaid money. I had made an error in planning a programme and had publicly á\\naccepted the mistake, despite repeated requests not to bring the á\\nmatter for discussion a professor kept constantly passing remarks. á\\nI reacted angrily.á\\n  A few days back a friend of mine poked me in the ribs for fun\\'s á\\nsake, though I had warned him an infinite number of times that it á\\nreally hurts me, he did it again.

I was á\\nreally angry with him then. Once I had an argument with my friends and I knew that I was á\\nright.  My friends went on arguing with me even though they did á\\nnot know the right thing. [ During my childhood when I could not get what I wanted from my á\\nbrother/sister and parents.] [ Ther are many instances which are all equally irritating.] Sometime ago I felt very angry when my mother wrote me telling me á\\nthat my elder sister was messing up things at home by her á\\ninternalised aggressive attitude towards parents and her husband.

Had an insulting letter from my father. Someone talking about me at my back. Being told that I have not got a personality. Insulted by other people in the shop. Being mistreated by other people. Being told that I am a stupid person. Being sexually assulted on a bus and noone helped (people only á\\nlaughed). Some boys deliberately played tricks on me in the experiments.\\n Your prejudice against psychology students and education students á\\n(not allowing us to go to the medical university lectures). Being insulted in public for the wrong reason. Misunderstood by friends. Some foreign students playing loud music before the biology á\\nexamn. Quarreling with classmates. Someone told me that I was chosen for English lectures because á\\nthe class leader is going out with me (not true). My best friend betrayed me and told other people my secrets. Being insulted by my roommate. People not resprcting my opinion. Being insulted on a bus. My parents do not like my friend and told me to stay away from á\\nhim. I quarrelled with my brothers (twins) at home on saturday.  One á\\nof them studies in a private school and the other one is á\\nrepeating his form five.  They do not know what they are doing.  á\\nThey follow every word of their teachers, books and systems.  á\\nThey always try to rationalize their bad acts by some game and á\\nthey are satisfied with their awkward life.  I have tried to á\\npersuade them very often but have failed.  This time I had a á\\nfight as they have no voluntary spirit (they did not polish the á\\nfloor). I had left a student newspaper of the Chinese university on the á\\ntable of the library.  It had disappeared when I came back. I had too much homework and examinations and I did not know how á\\nto organize my work. In the student\\'s union there was someone who took the photocopies á\\nof two large volumes.  I asked him to let me take a few, he refused á\\nit for an acceptable reason.  Last week, my organization summoned an executive meeting and one á\\nof the executive member\\'s pointed out a loop hole in the á\\ncommittee\\'s administration.  He could not suggest any á\\nimprovements, so I quarrelled with him. When I was concentrating on my work, my friend disturbed me á\\ncontinously.  I asked him to stop but in vain. I had planned to study for my mid-term exams on a certain day and  á\\nmy room-mate called me to ask me to go out for a stroll.  I tried á\\nto make an excuse so as not to go out but she refused to listen á\\nto me and insisted that I go out with her.  I find it unnecessary  á\\nto talk to her anymore.á\\n The trick was really intolerable.  They hid it, and I was worried á\\nand restless all day.  When I saw them I really wanted to slap á\\neach one of them. I was scolded by my mother for no reason. I had a date with a friend to see a movie and my friend was late. á\\n I waited for a long hour and was very angry. [ No response.] [ No response.] Before the certificate examination I was very poor in Biology á\\n(the worst result in my class).  Ever since F.5 it had been á\\ngetting poorer and poorer.  I had tried my best and had spent á\\nmost of my time studying this subject.  Finally my results were á\\nso bad that I thought that it was just not fair. Before the department meeting my friend ate a dish that I had á\\nprepared for this meeting. My elder brother often criticizes my mother\\'s cooking.  Once he á\\ndid it very impolitely and lost his temper.  This made all of us á\\nvery sad.  I was very angry and I scolded him.  He asked me not á\\nto interfere with what was his buisness. Mr C took my drawing pens, without having asked for my permission á\\nfirst, and lost them.  He did not tell me about it till I asked á\\nhim and then did not try to find them. My cassmate laughed at me when I was being scolded by the á\\nteacher. [ No response.] When I was studying in the library - preparing for a test, two á\\npeople sitting next to me talked to each other for 20 minutes.  á\\nThere were no other seats so I could not go elsewhere and I did   á\\nnot want to interrupt them, so I could only be angry in my heart. One night I could not practise my violin as my family was á\\nwatching T.V with the lights off, so I wanted to listen to some á\\ntapes.  It was dark so I asked my brother to bring me a torch, á\\nhowever he scolded me.  I was so angry that I slammed my violin á\\non the floor. When I came back to my hostel, my bed was full of newspapers and á\\ndirty clothes.  My room-mate asked me to wash the clothes for him á\\nas he had no time (this was his responsibility).  The food we á\\nshared had been eaten up by him (I ate little). My classmate always borrowed my notes and would not return it to á\\nme on time.  When I had a test she was selfish and irresponsible á\\nand so delayed my studies. I gave tutorial to a student and I found that he was lazy, he did á\\nnot pay attention to what I taught.  He did some easy questions á\\nwrong deliberately. My classmate used her personal relations to get a seat for a á\\nsubject that I wanted also.  I had taken the pains to help him á\\napply and I did not get selected.  I did not like this as he had á\\nnot told me the facts earlier, he need not have lied to me. Something was stolen. My intimate girlfriend told me that her father was opposed to our á\\nrelationship  and had insulted my integrity. Someone played a trick on me. I worked with several classmates on a project.  I was very á\\nanxious about the project while my partners showed no concern  á\\nand when we had meetings on the project my classmates  did not á\\npay any attention.  Some of them read books while the others á\\nargued on irrelevant questions.  The meeting would go on for two á\\nhours without the main theme being discussed.  We wasted time and á\\ncould not reach a compromise.  My classmates avoided doing the á\\nwork and the responsibilities, they seemed to value other á\\nprojects more than this one. My girlfriend disliked it when I played majong (a game of gambling).  á\\nI expressed my regrets and when I went to see her she neglected my á\\nexistance.  I was very angry and left in displeasure. During a football match, the other team was rude and they hurt my á\\nteam members and me.  The coach was prejudiced against us and á\\npunished us unreasonably.  Later we fought with each other and á\\nthe match had to be cut short. Yesterday I read in the newspaper that a 30 year old woman had á\\nabused her 2 month old son and had caused his death.  I was very á\\nangry after reading this as this is not a human act and to abuse á\\nso fragile a life is not a forgivable sin. [ Whenever I put myself in other\\'s shoes and try to make the á\\nperson happy, comfort him or make friends and I am misunderstood á\\nand rejected, especially when this person is a family member or a friend.] When I learnt that a friend of mine had talked about me to á\\nanother friend and had said wrong things about my abilities and á\\nattitudes.  I was very angry. One day, I discussed a very important question with A.  A á\\nsuddenly declared that he would not accept my position and á\\nthought that he himself was right.  Moreover, he attacked  á\\nstrongly, not my opinion but me personally. Once my father slapped my mother for a small quarrel. A female classmate was always late for meetings which were for á\\nthe homework and not social gatherings.  We were very busy and á\\nthe deadline was close but we had to waste half an hour or an á\\nhour waiting for her as we could do nothing else then. One day I had sunned my favourite shirt and was putting it back á\\nin the wardrobe when my younger brother snatched it from me and á\\nwore it.  He had not had a bath and was very dirty.  I scolded him á\\nbut he answered back and locked himself up in a room.  I was very á\\nangry so I starteed kicking on the door and abusing him loudly á\\nand freely. I had a very good friend in secondary school.  The year after our á\\ngraduation I prepared to celebrate her birthday and I called off á\\nall my appointments.  I got together the other friends and we á\\nwere ready to give the entire day to her.  However this friend á\\ndisappeared on her birthday.  When I phoned another friend I á\\ndidcovered thay she was busy, I did not call her anymore. My sister once stole my mother\\'s money and made her very angry.  á\\nAfter this my mother would beat her up for unreasonable reasons.  á\\nOne day my sister lent her book to a friend without telling my á\\nmother about it.  When my mother learnt this she beat her up and á\\neven threatened her with a pair of scissors.   When I was in F4 I played a basket-ball match against another á\\nschool\\'s team.  One of their team members kicked a team-mate of á\\nmine so I kicked him back and we had a fight with each other. I had a date with my girlfriend, the time and place had not been á\\nfixed.  I asked her to phone me an hour later as it was midnight á\\nand I did not want to disturb her family.  I waited several hours á\\nfor her call, she did not call me that night. I was a prefect at secondary school.  On the sports day I told á\\nothers that I would take down the names of the people who á\\nmisbehaved and after some time I sat down for a brief rest.  á\\nSuddenly the head prefect came and scolded me in front of others. á\\n I was very angry as there were other prefects sitting and he á\\npicked on me.  I thought that a brief rest was not  serious á\\nenough to be blamed. When I got into a bus I found that my wallet had been stolen. á\\nIt was not a great loss from the monetary point of view but I á\\nlost some documents - identity papers.  As a result I had to á\\nspend several days in order to get a new one.  I will always á\\nremember all the work I had to do and the bad treatment I á\\nsuffered because of the bureaucratic behaviour of the civil á\\nservant.  I had already had bad luck and they treated me like a á\\ncriminal.   At one point of time I really wanted to quarrel with á\\nthem. The day the results of the Chinese university was announced I á\\nshould have been very happy; however my grandmother, because of  á\\nher prejudice and misunderstanding, started a  quarrel with my á\\nmother.  She expected me to take her side and she deliberately á\\ntalked of my mother\\'s wrong doings.  I was very angry because - á\\none my grandmother was not being reasonable and two because it á\\nshould have been a happy day and three we had moved into a new á\\nhouse that day. Last week I had planned to play tennis and had booked a tennis á\\ncourt.   However when I arrived at the university gym the clerk á\\ntold me that the court was being used for lessons. My friend often played a joke on me and sometimes I thought that á\\nhe was a nonsensical person. Once when we went to a friend\\'s á\\nhouse he walked in first and shut the door firmly behind him.  I á\\nfelt that he did not respect me and moreover I was his friend so á\\nhe should not have behaved like that.  I was very angry (as it is á\\nI was in a bad mood then). We had fixed time for practice as we had to participate in the á\\ninter-department song contest.  I arrived and found that there á\\nwas nobody there.  When I went to the canteen I found them eating á\\nlunch.  I was so angry that I aired my greviances to one of them á\\nand then left. Whenever my father smokes the smell makes me feel very á\\nuncomfortable.  He never listens to my complaints and I curse him á\\nfuriously in my mind.  I cannot solve this problem by violence á\\nbecause of traditional moral values.   I came across a girl at the school bus-stop, I had seen her á\\nseveral friends as she was a friend\\'s friend.  However my friend á\\nhad never introduced me to her and when she got off the bus I á\\nsmiled at her but she did not respond pretending not to have seen á\\nme.  Her arrogant behaviour made me sick and angry. My friend half-teasingly called me a bad nickname.  I felt á\\ninsulted and kicked his hip in anger.  I was stable later and did á\\nnot feel angry at him.  In fact I was afraid that the other á\\nfriends who were with us would think that I was an intolerant á\\nperson.  However I could not apologize, so I pretended that á\\nnothing had happened and smiled when I left.  My friend did not á\\nsay anything but just watched me leave. Someone spread rumours about me. When I saw that my bed at the hostel was a mess I guessed that á\\nsomeone else had used my daily necessities.  I felt that my  personal á\\nsanity had been affected. The surname of my brother was different from ours.  He often á\\ngrinned at home and provoked others for the pleasure of it.  This á\\nmade me angry. In September 1984, I was forced to live with someone I did not á\\nlike.  The first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation á\\nwas like a debate.  The atmosphere was very bad.  When he learnt á\\nthat I had got 95 marks in a test he told me \" A failure, You lost á\\n5 marks.\"   I was very angry, not because my marks were lower á\\nthan his, but because I could not tolerate his pride.  I did not á\\nshow my discontentment and carried on doing my work. Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her á\\ngrand-daughter.  The grand-daughter asked me some questions in á\\nmathematics so I taught her.  However she did not listen to me á\\nand this made me feel unhappy.  The second year it was the same.  á\\nWhen I entered university the girl\\'s parents suggested that I be á\\nemployed as their daghters tutor.  They told me that at university  á\\nthere was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they á\\nmade a time-table  for me which required me to be the tutor five á\\ndays a week.  They did not respect me and anyway I had another á\\nchild to teach. abhor abhorr abhorrence abomin abominate abomination aggrav aggravate aggravated aggravation aggress aggression aggressive aggressiveness amok amuck anger angered angri angrili angrily angry animos animosity animus annoy annoyance annoyed annoying antagon antagonism avarici avaricious bad_blood bad_temp bad_temper baffl baffled balk balked bedevil begrudg begrudge begrudging belliger belligerence belligerency belligerent belligerently bitter bitterness bother bothersom bothersome brood chafe choler choleric class_feel class_feeling contemn covet covetous covetously covetousness crucifi crucify dander despis despisal despise despising despit despiteful detest detestation devil discourag discouraged disdain displeas displease displeased displeasing displeasingly displeasur displeasure dudgeon dun enfuri enfuriate enmiti enmity enrag enraged enragement envi enviabl enviable enviably envious enviously enviousness envy evil exacerb exacerbate exasper exasperate exasperating exasperation execr execrate execration fit frustrat frustrate frustrated frustrating frustration furi furious furiously fury gall galling get_at get_to grabbi grabby grasp grasping gravel greedi greedy green-ey green-eyed green-eyed_monst green-eyed_monster grievanc grievance grizzl grizzle grudg grudge grudging hackl hackles harass harassed harassment harri harried hate hateful hatefully hatr hatred heartburn heartburning high_dudgeon hostil hostile hostilely hostility huffi huffili huffily huffiness huffish huffishness huffy ill_temp ill_temper ill_wil ill_will incens incense incensed indign indignant indignantly indignation infuri infuriate infuriated infuriating infuriation irasc irascibility irascible ire irrit irritate irritated irritating irritation jealous jealousi jealously jealousy livid lividity lividly loath loathe loathing mad madden maddened maddening madness malef malefic maleficence malevol malevolence malevolent malevolently malic malice malici malicious maliciously maliciousness malign malignity misanthrop misanthropi misanthropic misanthropical misanthropy misocainea misogami misogamy misogyn misogyni misogynic misogynism misogyny misolog misology mison misoneism misopedia murder murderously murderousness nark nettl nettle nettled nettlesom nettlesome odium offend offens offense oppress outrag outrage outraged overjeal overjealous peev peeved persecut persecute peski pesky pester pestered pestering pestifer pestiferous piqu pique piss pissed plaguey plaguy pout prehensil prehensile provok provoked quick_temp quick_temper rag rage rancor rancour resent resentful resentfully resentment reveng revengefully rile riled roil roiled scene score scorn see_r see_red short_temp short_temper sore spite spiteful spitefulness spleen stew stung sulk sulki sulkiness sulky tantal tantalize tantrum teas teasing temper the_green-eyed_monst the_green-eyed_monster torment umbrag umbrage umbrageous veng vengefully vengefulness venom vex vexat vexati vexation vexatious vexed vexing vindict vindictive vindictively vindictiveness warpath with_hostil with_hostility wrath wrathful wrathfully wroth wrothful '"

              "' when i had been obviously unjustly treated and had no possibility of elucidating this when a car is overtaking another and i am forced to drive off the road when one is unjustly accused of something one has not done friends who torture animals when my partner was attacked and lost three teeth unjust accusations directed at me and my way of acting by someone close to me   when i heard on the radio that the football match in belgium had ended in a catastrophe and several people had died  i could not  understand how normal people could behave in such a way at my summer job nobody looked after me in particular and i had to learn all on my own when i spoke to janerik wikstr÷m on the telephone  i locked myself out at work when an elderly man complained unjustifiably about me and distrusted me mad at my dad when someone stole my bike when friends try to put me down or hurt me   when my boyfriend went away for a month long holiday without me at a restaurant i observed how the gypsies tried to get money by cheating the foreigners ie non swedish speaking  my anger had nothing to do with hatred against foreigners but it was an expression of the anger i feel when i see people being used  when i got caught in the pouring rain last thursday and did not have a raincoat on me when a colleague asked me for help at work despite the fact that he had more time to do it than i had the editor changed the heading of an article that i had written  he considered the heading to be derogatory towards the person i had written about on the tv i saw a news feature on south africa  a policeman      attacked a group of black people with a whip we were starting a student project and the teacher we talked to was very negative and not very helpful being treated unfairly i was accused of having done something which i hadnt and got very angry i went to a lecture and once again it had been cancelled this was the second time  one had a negative attitude towards the lecturer in the holiday cottage of our association two of my pals came to wake me up early one morning by bringing a radio played at the highest volume into my room  it was the morning service at its loudest we were in a disco and the evening was not at all pleasant  despite my not knowing why i was angry with my companion  i let him feel my bad humour as i cannot hide my feelings  i sometimes quarrel with my mother because she blames me though i have not in any way been connected to some events two boys whom i know were telling me in an indecent manner how they had teased a young and shy girl i know  they had despised her conviction scorned and touched her  i got very angry and did not try to conceal it and gave it back to them when my tennis match was interrupted because a kid cycled right into the court i had a very heavy work load and two colleagues whom i have nothing against disturbed me by terror ringing ie continously interrupting me by telephoning when i was deputy manager during the summer certain deputies took liberties more than what was normal i reached the bus stop and realized that i had forgotten my bus pass when someone does something wrong which affects me negatively i saw a report on tv news on apartheid in south africa  the time when someone let the air out of the tyres of my cycle  when i missed the tram after having run for it when i am accused of something i have not done i get unbelievably angry someone drove into my car and then denied that it had happened quarrel in the family my car had been towed away by the traffic police because it had been wrongly parked  however the sign had been put up only after i had already parked a colleague asked me for some advice and as he did not have enough confidence in me he asked a third person when close relatives tried to dissuade me from studying psychology because of its low status my employer took too many aspirins for a bad back and also drank an enormous amount of spirit  this was dangerous  and he did not understand that he had done anything wrong the sports fishermen who catch gulls instead of fish with their hooks   it is often a mistake but it makes me angry when i found out that the guy i was dating at a particular time had a steady relationship going on with someone else for a long time when after a week at school a teacher sent a note home saying that my son was inattentive and unable to do his lessons when i was pointed out as a problem child in primary school and my mother took the teachers point of view when my parents drove me to a nearby place and went home immediately instead of waiting a few hours  they could have easily waited when we were in high school a few guys sometimes provoked a friend of mine  they called her a pig and then grunted  this irritated most of the girls  once one of the girls got angry at my friend and said something nasty and this made me terribly angry when my boyfriend sat up half the night playing computer games with a friend when my mother interfered in my life when my father asked me if i was a communist at the same time he made it clear that i should no longer see myself as his daughter when my boss enrolled in a course to satisfy his own ends  to trample on his associates  i have the misfortune to have one of my superiors in my course when my friend as usual forgot the tickets at home for a performance  we missed it when i tried to explain to a plumber face to face that the toilet was broken and he did not believe it it had been mended ten times when i read about reagans tactical decision concerning the south african boycott some noisy guests arrived at the hotel  i had been slightly irritated earlier  at night when i was trying to sleep they were having a party so i went and yelled at them  i wanted to sleep as i had to get up early the next day recently when my sister who is four years younger than me and very spoiled shouted at my mother for no apparent reason   the heartbroken expression on my mothers face made me feel very angry on the way home from marstrand i was driving behind my fathers car  another car tried to push in front of my father and he was forced to swerve and he thus collided the car with a pillar  the other car drove off without even seeing what had happened in a course i thought that i deserved good marks but i only got ordinary marks with no justification as to why i was given these marks when it became clear that a man had used many people sexually and psychologically despite the fact that many people looked up to him  i understood that one could not trust him and i was forced to hide this for a while when after a lot of provocation my child threw a plate on the floor when i was forced to call the telephone company about a bill concerning a disconnected phone belonging to my landlord  the bill was four months overdue and in the meanwhile he had been using my phone he seemed to have no intention of having his own phone reconnected  jealous of my husbands old girlfriend  we met her with her husband and there was a lot of reminiscing exchange of points of view with my sister on a family matter at a cash desk where i had gone to buy  rolls of kitchen paper at a reduced price  after queuing with screaming children it turned out that i had taken two  roll packets instead of the one  roll packet to which the rebate applied  the assistant said you will have to get it another time an unjust refree decision at a sports event when i was the team leader a drummer who had borrowed my drums destroyed both the drumskin and the sticks  he did not repair them nor did he tell me about it when i told off a computer teacher who did not want to teach me beacause of prejudice   when the morning newspaper has not arrived when i argue with my boyfriend i feel as though he feels superior to me when during winter the water pipes froze and we did not have any water for two days when our religion teacher presented shocking sectarian thoughts and dooms day as official teaching in the student kitchen that we share somebody drank from my juice pot one litre so that i only got one glass out of the whole pot i missed the train and had to wait for the next for two hours for this reason i missed an appointment which had been very important for me i was watching tv with a friend after the first film i wanted to watch another film on the same channel my friend switched over to the other cannel without asking me what i wanted i moved to a flat a friend who had lived there before had left the flat in a terrible mess i was very angry about that sloppiness and impudence a friend suggested in a roundabout way that the reason we were late for something was because of me and that im often late i know this was partly true but felt it unjustified that particular time and i felt i couldnt do  anything about it anyway ie being late during a fight with my best friend at my fathers treatment of my mother at his disregard for her and not being committed to her i told my boy friend not to park in a certain place because the car would ger towed away  he didnt listen and it was towed away at that stage our finances were below the poverty line  it cost us   all the money we had to get us through that week including rent getting a terrible exam mark which i couldnt understand the reason for and trying to see a lecturer or tutor but being given the runaround when a close relative is treated badly when my fathers new fiancee treats me like a child  she does not trust me and constantly misunderstands me  i get particularly angry when she says nasty things about my boyfriend with whom she works my parents did not approve my choice of a boyfriend now an exboyfriend  he happened to be  years older than me and he was considered completely unsuitable for me  idiot there was a sofa in my flat which belonged to the old tenants who were acquaintances  it should have been picked up a year ago but they had postponed it  eventually they decided on one date and i stayed at home despite the fact that i had other things to do  they did not come nor did they call and they still have not got in touch with me a girl i was with went off with another guy  my father and i had an argument because i do not help enough at home quarrelled with my younger brother a lady i live with had not bothered to clean up before she went   on holiday i live in a collective  the sight of a man who ran amok fighting at a dance with the job appointments committee when the headmaster in charge explained that a male teacher was more suitable for the particular post  i had more years of service than the male teacher but this was not taken into consideration  i could have been given a less attractive job if things had gone the way the headmaster wanted someone didnt show up at a meeting in spite of having agreed to come when i tried to put up a tent some years ago i was teased and hindered by my cousin a drunken friend of mine was beating up another friend who was also drunk my mother and her friends were speaking badly about my father when they were separated and my brothers and sisters and myself were allowed to listen i was accused of a misdemeanour unjustly meeting generally dominating persons in social occasions when my father phoned me to come home from my vacation since he no longer had the time to look after my garden and animals when my car suddenly broke down  angry with my brother who was making fun of me teasing me being subject to unfair treatment in a working group someone bending the rules was protected by the boss this resulted in more work for the others one of my best friends accused me of giving up to early on problems it was only a casual remark on her side but i was angry and hurt i was subject to false accusations and got very angry i felt unfairly treated at an airport being told to use a different counter for domestic traffic only when students in our working group showed no responsibility or interest in our work my nephew is a deaf and also hyperactive boy i had been responsible for looking after him for a full day and was very tired then he suddenly grabbed a knife and stabbed me in the leg i got so angry that i didnt feel any pain a close friend first said he accepted an agreement but later used that agreement as a reason for attacking me when i tried to breake it up with my boyfriend and he refused to let me go having a fight with a class mate i get angry when people disbelieve me or misunderstand me being a spokesman for the union i got into a quarrel with a colleague who had been acting disloyally over a sustained period of time when others let me down fail to keep agreements i was accused of having drunk a bottle of liquor and then refilling with water when colliding with my car i myself was to blame when my mother treats me as a  old boy having agreed to share the taxi expenses three people in the back of the car just ran off leaving the person up front with the entire bill realizing that a friend had been talked into signing a certain contract receiving personal criticisms early in the morning physical violence a friend wouldnt listen to me i repeatedly tried to warn him to no avail result eight people were pissed off in traffic i often get relatively angry with other drivers several transgressions make me mad especially not yielding to priority traffic eg coming from the right having gone to school without learning anything as usual being slandered by friends angry when our team small boys lost the county championship football final my father accused my brother of having bumped his car and it was wrong i had a discussion with my mother concerning my sisters divorce we disagreed strongly a conflict with a pupil  my fiancee and i were at my parents place watching tv there were  only two tvchairs and we were sitting on them when my drunken brother came in and rudely chased my fiancee off the chair she was sitting on when a girl left me while in the army i was treated unfairly by my superiors  i was held responsible for a deed of which i was innocent when stupid people push me during rush time in the city  i had an implicit agreement with my sister about meeting her however she had not understood the situation the same way so she did not turn up when i learned that my brother had spoilt an lp of mine after having quarelled with a relative of mine about politics i was disappointed and angry at the bad quality of a documentay program on tv  in my opinion the topic was important and the program should have been made with seriousness and consideration when i realized that i was far behind the others in the language course and i could no longer catch up with the others i was angry with a friend of mine who behaved in an affected manner when i did not find the rack used for beating up rugs in the yard i had an appointment downtown and the person in question was half an hour late i was coming home in a taxi with a fellow worker of mine  he was criticizing my earlier conduct towards him which to my mind was unfounded  when i reached home i ran out of the taxi and slammed the door a person close to me mistook my good intentions for bad and therefore associated unpleasant traits to me my superior blamed me for some neglects at work in front of others  in fact the task in question was not supposed to be done by me a relative of mine had come to see my husband to talk to him about a problem concerning his sister and me  i was angry because this relative of mine did not dare to speak to me and instead spoke to my husband  i got to know about it later the same day i am a school teacher  one of the classes does not obey me at all keeps on talking does no work  one afternoon everything went wrong and i got exceedingly angry my mother carried on using mental pressure concerning something which was serious and a real burden to me on the tv news i heard that nicaragua had complained about the increasing threat of war with the usa when i checked my examination paper and realized that i had been careless thoughtless lazy and hasty so as to make unnecessary mistakes concerning things i know and understand a member of a religious sect tried to convert me using really evil tricks to persuade me  after he had left i was anxious and angry for a long time after the event i was alone my father had once again told me that i should be careful and try to seek admission to other places also apart from the faculty of social sciences at the university of helsinki  i was not at all interested in any other place and had no time to study for other entrance exams when my roommates were watching videotapes and prevented me from watching the news  the first feeling i had was that i was being treated unfairly and then came the feeling of anger my friends promised me that they would definitely call me to tell me if they were visiting me or not when a friend of mine was drawn into a fight because of the stupid gang he belonged to i felt angry with him and his friends they could not think about anything sensible but would fool around without taking into consideration the feelings of other persons my mother had for some time been trying to separate me from a good friend who she thought was not good company for me  finally at breakfast one day we had an argument and i tried to defend my friend my lifepartner who was drinking more and more spoke about kicking the cat  he had never done anything of the kind but i knew that he would do so one day without thinking about it a friend of mine ridiculed me telling me that i would never accomplish anything i felt that he had interfered with my life while having a discussion with my mother i realized that she does not for a moment doubt the justification of her making the decisions concerning my life the outrageous conduct of a relative towards me and those close to meblaming us and lying  i was at home filling my tax report  nobody had time to help me  i would have liked to do it quickly so that i could go and meet a friend of mine who had just returned from hospital  i got angry as both my brother and my father refused to give me their calculator as i had not asked for it nicely  i could not leave as i had to wait for help and the tax report had to be done the housing council asked the city to cut  linden trees so that the inhabitants of the lower floors would have a view to the sea my boyfriend came home late one night without having told me about it before when i heard that my stepmother had treated my mother in a wrong manner in a tram the ticket seller was commanding taking the role of a leader trying to emphasize her nonexistent authority with undue strictness towards a goodhumoured drunk who could not find his ticket at once a male honduran acquaintance of mine despised my opinions during the summer at my workplace a person kept interfering with my tasks and making unfounded remarks  i felt hatred for him but it stopped when i realized that he just longed for attention when i quarelled with my parents a higher status colleague of mine despised my attitude and organization of work they had returned much less of my taxes than i had expected my parents put pressure on me to buy clothes when i would not have liked to do so disagreements with mother  when i moved from kankaanpss she had promised to help me move but broke her promise because of some hindrance  i was angry at my boyfriend who had promised to come to see me but did not because he spent the evening with his pals an utterance which i had intended to be a joke was taken as an offence  in my opinion this was stupid and i got angry i got angry at a friend of mine whom i caught reading my notebook almanach when my sister took my things without having asked for my permission first my brother told me that a person whom i know had insulted him  i am very fond of my brother and as he himself can not get angry or hurt my protectiveness was aroused and i got angry when i saw a big man hit another one and nobody did anything without my permission my son had made popcorn after coming back from school  the consequences were a spoilt kettle and chaos in the kitchen but what could have happened with the hot grease  i was on vacation and therefore i did not attend a meeting of the day care centre  nevertheless the very day i came back they called me early morining to ask me what are you going to do about the matter  which had been discussed in the meeting  then i got angry one winter day i unwillingly was outdoors with my younger brother  years younger than me  i lost my temper on him and wanted to throw my brother down the snow bank we were on  i pushed him but not as hard as i had wanted to we were alone the two of us a friend of mine had promised to arrange me some tickets for a concert which i considered important  he could not get them the way he thought he would so he gave up the whole thing the last day of school is traditionally celebrated by singing a song about all the students who are leaving  in the song about me there were things which irritated me a lot i read in the newspaper that the student lodging fund was going to build new appartments for refugees in my opinion this is the states affair  this is when only a fractoin of the students can find an appartment while playing a ball game i was just about to make a goal when i was thrown off my feet and i failed to score the goal when i came for the lesson it was cancelled and i had to fill in a questionnaire instead my girlfriend started singing she cannot sing and did not stop despite my asking her to do so new years eve party in the country i hardly knew a person my partner spent most of the time at the bar i had little opportunity to get to know people because our table was separated and my boyfriends parents were present at the weekend i wanted to be absent from school because of a sports event but my teacher refused to give me the day off because he didnt like me i had a quarrel with my parents i was convinced to be right i wanted to go to a friend of mine who had a party at the moment i wanted to leave my father said i couldnt go because he needed me for some work in the afternoon i wanted to see a friend i had been looking forward to it and had certain expectations but he did not pay any attention to me played cards with other people recently a good friend only called me when he needed something he never said please or thank you or any other kind word when i lost my driving license because i had been driving while under the influence of alcool a colleague asked me to study with her i could not explain things as perfectly as she had expected so she reacted in an aggressive manner when we rearranged furniture in our flat and got stuck in a chair i helped my little sister  years learning mathematics obviously she did not want to understand what i explained and started to cry i grew angry a friend of mine tried to persuade me to go at her place to act as a model because she felt too tired it was a quarter of an hour before the appointed time i had just lied down and did not want to go because it was too late anyway she said that i only was talking about looking for work but if it was possible i would not accept it i was angry about this unjust judgment a friend called me and told me that she wanted to come and see me she lived in a village at  km distance fom my home town next morning i expected her but she didnt arrive as i got impatient i called her but her parents told me that she had gone skiing i was very angry because i had cancelled an appointment to be able to see her at the hairdressers i got two stains of dyestuff on my new trousers these stains are not removable so i cannot put on the trousers again a friend who shares the room with me opened the window in the morning and left the room the whole day when i came home in the evening the room was so cold that i couldnt stay there i arrived in vienna in the middle of the night i asked for some silly information  as i realized myself afterwards  and the inquiry  clerk reacted in a very arrogant manner i wanted to clear up a misunderstanding with a friend that i had caused a third person meddled in our conversation turned my efforts to ridicule so that i did not succeed in what i had intended i went singing with a group of young people on january  the three magi a local custom called star singing one of the girls my girlfriend broke the star being the accompanying person i felt very angry thinking of the consequences during a lecture a colleague who did not know anything about the subject got on my nerves asking silly questions during the christmas holdidays i wanted to invite my brother his girlfriend and their child for dinner when i said to my brothers girlfriend that i would like them to come at my place for dinner she refused and never mentioned it again as if i had never asked her after an exhausting day i came home and wanted to take a bath to relax my father wanted to take a bath first and when he had finished after an hour there was no hot water left for me my mother treated me unjustly as if i was a little child i said mean things i was unable to defend myself adequately it happened in a tram some older people started to grumble about the young people just because i had not immediately left my seat to them at the end of my holiday job i got less money than was due to me and nobody mentioned anything about that i share my small flat with my

about any doubt about the job and he didnt care didnt answer me leaving me speaking alone when a person is privileged in account of situations that are unjust and disloyal to colleagues and friends once in my work it happened a fight between the person in charge and me i got so angry and spoke out everything i felt at the moment when my boss cut off my vacations saying that in that month it wouldnt be possible and after some time he let another girl take vacations that month the anger was because of the resentment resulting from our bad relationship when my mother slapped me in the face i felt anger at that moment when i was robbed in a bus one day i lent my tennis i just had washed to my sister because she asked it i asked her not to soil it as i had just washed it next day i looked at the tennis and it was dirty with wax she could not have soiled it it was lack of consideration i felt very angry in certain occasion i have a fight with my boyfriend during the fight i closed the door at his face he went away but came back next day my mother in law slept in my bed in the last year of the high school we had a huge fight between my group and the graduation commission two

girl entered in the division where i work and greeted everybody but not me when my chief accused me of an error that i hadnt made i dont use to lie to my parets about what i do and the two times that i felt anger were when they doubted me i said that i was going to the club and they didnt believe me because the day before they had met me at fliperama i had the wish to kill them when i was misleaded by a person who assured that something would not occur that i had no reason to prepccupy myself and suddenly i saw myself implicated by the fact because of the incompetence and irresponsibility of that person i felt anger when i saw that i was being misleaded by my boyfriend he went out with other girls i felt anger for his falsity when my sister took something that belonged to me without my permission when i realized that the person i was courting hadnt been really by my side for a long time already he had deceived me and i let him deceive me i felt much anger and

had a serious argument with a dear person discussion with my mother about the way to educate my children i felt anger against my mother and she said absurd things false things that filled my ears and inflated my head which seemed to be caught in a carcass where the heart wanted to explode and where the arm wanted to knock down the world i felt much anger when my fahter interferred in my relations with another person whom i liked very much ending something that i adored when a colleague was rude with me because she didnt understand the subject about which i was discussing i felt anger against a person who told bad things about me in my absence i was on a farm with a few friends and during the talk i discovered that a friend of mine was being betrayed by her boyfriend and a  friend of ours

things having nothing to do with football i felt anger against a colleague of mine during a rehearsal in acting he hadnt learnt the text of an opera act in the course of several months and thus making difficulties for the rest of my colleagues i felt it on the same occasion when i felt sadness which finally grew into anger i had an accident with a trafic police car that was packed at a curve without any visibility and against all traffic regulations in a strong snowstorm as a result i still cannot repair my car because of the missing spare parts a whole crowd of us went to a folklore festival the instructor of the cast where my boyfriend played was traveling with us we decided to catch the train that leaved early in the morning because we had business on the following day the instructor tried to get the upper hand and made us catch the train in spite of everything all the time he made me angry when my friend girl promised to help me go to the hospital and be examined by good experts and she deceived me when you are unjustly assessed at something you are sure to have been right they wanted something to happen but i didnt i shared a secret with a friend and it later turned out that he had revealed it to another person with whom i didnt get along very well i get angry with people who attain certain status without deserving it only with the support authority and

some manners of dealing and some sanctioned relations a close person lied to me unjust punishment of a friend of mine at an unjust or to be more precise at a bureaucratic treatment of ones personality anger i felt when my boyfriend told me he didnt mind breaking it off with me ie each of us to take his own road because until that moment he deliberately restricted our dates the motives were brought to my knowledge later in a conversation my boyfriend expressed definite and quite pretentious opinions and he took up an attitude towards a theory which he himself had never known his information was from fortuitous sources i feel this feeling when i am to fill in a questionnaire or a form unfair and unjust attitude toward a person close to me what i was the witness of caused anger in me the doctors from belogradchik town determined a wrong diagnosis to my son a month later after some complex examinations at isul a medical institute in sofia the diagnosis was categorically rejected when i

even more with the girl whom i may be loved truly when she refused to come with me to an occasion she was from another town i felt it when a girl who was dear to me lied to my face i got angry with the fact that she knew i didnt believe her but she kept on telling lies when my husband stays late at a meeting and i have to be alone i got angry when i learned how short a time we had to prepare for

they had misrepresented the truth i felt deeply hurt when i learned that it was done by a good acquaintance of mine i confronted with this feeling at the institute quite recently the pedology lecturer was the cause when on a car journey a fellow student crossed our way with his own car and we had to bump into a roadside trunk i feel angry at peoples indifference at our ability to be present at an event and to stay partial to what happens it was necessary to organise a competition in connection with a celebration everyone was to be present at that event it turned out that there was no audience at all because everyone had pretended to be very intelligent and no one had come i got furious when my bosom friend tried to lie to me i felt anger at my last exam i felt angry with our teacher because he did not rate me objectively and i failed i felt angry when i failed in an exam about which i knew quite a few things and i did not deserve to be plucked that was what i felt with a teacher

the evening etc i was not present at the time my partner without discussing with me the situation decided it was time for us to have a break and went ahead and arranged his own life for the next  months then told me the day before it was about to happen having been tolerant and friendly for the preceding week this situation keeps occurring  when my little sister disagrees with me or viceversa we have very similar temperaments and i always end up feeling angry at her and myself for fighting so much over unimportant trivial matters because i am the captain of a basketball team i usually organise a roster system so that everyone in the team can have a turn at doing either a duty or a ref a lot of the time the girls cant be bothered or just forget  i usually have to fill in when my

wife  i had an argument with my father who abused my friend who was sticking up for me that a friend had been badly beaten and stabbed many times and the person that did it got away without any punishment from the law when bicycling along a courier van started to tail me very close  i sped up and moved over and he just did the same i reacted violently much physical responding in the dangerous situation deliberately provoked by someone close angered by the deliberation not the provocation when a close friend failed to live up to the expectations i had of him  thereby causing pain to his spouse i believe that my anger was probably a reaction of fear that i wouldnt be able to live up to my own expectations landlord putting up rents sneakly and slimily i was playing in a football tournament and saw the rules openly disregarded my sister and i were fighting as usual shes older tham i am bigger built and stronger i couldnt win in a physical battle and in a verbal battle i

deserve this i cooked the engine in my fathers car  it was actually his fault because he hadnt fixed the temperature gauge or told me when i finally got home i was absolutely screamed at and the anger i experienced was over the injustice of it all plus the huge row which developed my best friend at school told lies about me to a boy i was seeing and went out with him herself when someone ignores what i am saying or doesnt let me have my point of view and they monopolise a conversation as in sadness a relating to this slaghter of furseals stopped at a fast food shop with friends and a few

care for the key of the sportshall stayed away without letting us know next time he did as if nothing had happened i am a teacher in arts and crafts boys from  years for them it is obligatory and they dislike it they tease me when one of them cut up some material i flared up i work for a journal once the layout came to nothing due to thoughtlessness of some colleagues i invited two friends we should go out together those two girls kept talking about boys chatting up etc i bacame sick of it i was sleeping nicely until in the middle of the night when i became awake because a friend called me for some in my opinion nonsens reason when my father took away my cherised diaries to burn them i was also very sad oh how i hated him a quarrel with my mother because i thought she said very unreasonable things about me that hit me strongly when the coach of our team degraded me to the second team when anybody wants to make me feel guilty for example i should do something for my mother but things didnt go as she hoped then she threatens ill do it myself while playing indoorhockey there always is an older man who frequently and intentionally plays the ball out of the field in my opinion this is very childish because we play for fun only when late at night i discovered that they had stolen my bike when a friend who comes visiting me unexpectedly asks for coffee and i refuse to give him this my father promised me a bicycle for my birthday just before my birthday he forgot he promised this to me my bicycle was demolished last year i had a friend visiting me for several days the only thing he did was sleeping drinking taking pills and thinking only about himself my girlfriend does practice and therefore leaves me alone at night and in the weekend in addition she is very busy doing several things so we dont see each other often my parents thought that i didnt do my best to pass the final examination secondary school when i achieved a good grade they said nothing but if i had had a bad grade they would have become very angry when talking with my sister she often ventilates prejudices which my father also adheres when i arranged our holiday in paris and my girlfriend raised criticisms all the time i suffer from a disease of my muscles therefore i am only able to attend lectures for half a day so sometimes i miss obligatory lectures however the teachers do not take into account my disease and punish me with detention work resulting in an overload when a pickpocket robbed me of my money  while i  was buying bathing soap in  a sadist provoked my sister in my presence  he tried to force my sister into accompanying him to his place but my sister did not agree and so she was kicked and she fell down  there was a fight when my mother quarrelled with my aunt over me my younger brother destroyed and gave away some of the books that i had intended to keep for as long as possible when some seniors tried to scold and insult some juniors on account of what the juniors were supposed to have said at secondary school meddlesomeness of my mother about the way i live she thinks i am to free in my behavior for instance when a boyfriend stays the night a friend came to visit me late one night he promised to stay only a quarter of an hour but he stayed  hours  he didnt leave and i was very angry during military service a superior reproached me unjustly this led to friction in a lot of situations when a teacher tells a story which isnt true it only reflects his way of interpreting reality i work at a petrol station when there is a foreigner who wants petrol my collegues treat him very impolite the stories about the way my grandmother treated my mother i am usually angry at myself this happens often for instace when i want to pet without falling in love and it soon proves that i have fallen in love with him after a hard day at the university i also had to make dinner that evening it failed because of a frying pan which broke my older brother who gives me unwanted advices about problems in my relationship with my girlfriend being treated unfairly and being hurt by someone i love i had a quarrel with my father because i was of the opinion that he decided in an authoritarian way which tv program we should watch i became very angry and started throwing things through the room there was a lot of irritation between me and a person who lives in the same house where i live suddenly it became too much for me and i accused him of several things when i was at an official meeting i asked a question to a person his response was not directed at me but at the chairman i was in the library of medical psychology and walked into the wrong direction a man who came out of a room threated me very denigrating and i became very angry in a resisting manner a friend started to shout at me he called me an old frump seeing for the first time pictures about the so called treatment of jewish people in nazigermany during world war ii once again my parents distroyed a relationship i felt anger when at the end of a telephone call a good friend told me that she would go to travel next year with another good friend we couldnt talk this out when i got the feeling that i had to do all the housekeeping while my boyfriend didnt do anything this happened in a period of exams when i had to study very hard we had to move to a very different city because the company where my father worked also moved to that place it was very difficult for me to make new friends than i was very angry at my father when he didnt give me as much money as my brother to use for studying once again my brother was better off then me my boyfriend told me that i had very high demands towards him in my opinion this was wrong when our cat was killed in a caraccident i was very angry at the driver of the car because he didnt take enough care when people without my permission pry in my belongings and take things out of it i worked together with another student on a computerassignment she didnt do her best and didnt prepare herself for it she expected me to explain it to her my girlfriend one day went out and promised to be back at  pm however she first arrived at  pm without a message we had to go out that evening when a discussion resulted in an insult which in my opinion was not justified my father called me behind my mothers back and told me that my mother disapproved my behavior in the weekend however he didnt tell me the details and left me with unanswered questions when someone does not listen to me after having asked me to repeat what i said this happened more than one time with the same person out on a weekend with a group of people everybody felt irritated because at night the music didnt stop in time and at breakfast my boyfriend ran away because we didnt agree with him i felt angry someone told me that he would stay at my home for one night therefore i made big efforts to make everything ok food one day before he cancelled the appointment because he had to go to church with his parents when a very close friend with whom i have a very intimate and bodily relationship he had a girlfriend started to avoid me and didnt want to talk to me any more i made an appointment with a friend to drink coffee togehter however for the third time in that week she arrived an hour too late when after having cleaned up the kitchen two hours later i saw that there was a big mess it irritated me very much when being made look a fool by the teacher in front of the class during a turn a friend told me it would be better for me not to be on familiar terms with another friend although in my opinion he had no reason to say such things he only said so hoping that i would search support from him that however was not necessary i had made an appointment with three friends we had to go out together when i arrived at the place the other persons werent there i became very angry because i thought they were gone without me that however didnt appear to be the case a classmate urged me to carry out a particular protest along with him and when the time came this fellow drew back while i had to face the situation when i first saw a person begging we hitch hiked our way back from a town rather drunk  we were dropped in another town which was unknown to us  i needed to urinate so i did it on a wall which turned out to belong to the military headquarters  they arrested me and made me pay a fine of  pts  we had to go home on foot  km since it was too late for anyone to give us a lift at home when they lost three pieces of my puzzle my family told me to leave if i was not willing to accept the conditions they imposed on me once i saw some children hunting a cat to death when i was told that a boy did not want to be my friend without any apparent reason i had an argument with my mother because i criticized the rules she imposes at home which are too rigid and arbitrary for me i felt angry when i saw on tv the last slaughter of negroes in south africa during a trivial friendly discussion one of the participants made an intervention which made me feel uncomfortable when my father addressed me directly and maliciously thus including me in the family war a murder during an argument between friends one of them accused me of taking advantage of some other friends who usually come to the university in my car saying that i ask them too much money for the petrol my cousins were playing at home and one of them broke a decorative object which was very precious to me during a family discussion on my future and my prospects as a student they accused me of not bothering about looking for a job to assume my financial situation an argument among several friends because of the irrational behavior of one of them who fell out with us for no reason and said that we were to blame when i failed an exam unfairly when a professor of this faculty laughed at and was suspicious of a composition written by a classmate and me when i failed an exam i thought i would pass when i saw my brother being attacked and i could not do anything when i saw a man hitting a child of  years without any consideration simply because the child had been leaning against a window when i was young i became very angry as i was not allowed to stay up all night for the fair in my town i had an exam and i had it well prepared  i did the first part very well but did not know the second part when males in my family try to assign house duties exclusively with referance to sex when they threw my holder down on the floor with all my notes for an exam inside it and they got all mixed up an old woman was violently thrown down the stairs of the tube by a group of louts i learned that a classmate had given a list of peolpe who help each other in exams to the professor a typical family argument when you kill yourself with work and see the number of slakers wandering around doing nothing i was living in a flat where things did not go very well for me  finally they threw me out and this prejudiced people i esteem a lot i was angry when my sister began to talk nonsense and to laugh at the way i swept the room  my anger grew i tried to control myself  after telling her to leave me alone i vented my anger on her as she did not obey me when i miss the train and i am late and i have to wait half an hour for the next one in a very important basketball match where a lot was at stake i played very badly i was given an exam which i thought did not measure at all my ability or my knowledge of the subject when my brother was held up and robbed a person i trusted a lot gave me many false explanations to justify a wrong action when after drinking a glass of water i found a cockroach walking out of the glass we were at school in the room for audiovisual classes  we were watching a film and just behind me two classmates were bothering me with their mocking and shoves  i reacted angrily i suppose  by hitting one of them during my last exam on the occasion of assignment of tasks and responsibilities in which such an assignment dispropotionately carried with it high responsibility and low ability of organisation and resolution when they broke the artistic work of several weeks  changes were made and it was broken without permission they had no right to do this in a confrontation with a person he provoked me several times till i reacted in an angry way  fortunately there were no disastrous consequences when i had an argument with my best friend and i thought that i was right and she was not when i knew that they would not give me a transfer from one university to another  i began to insult the educatioon authorities and the government i ended up at the door my father began to say incoherant things concerning my brothers and my own behaviour towards him  his biased authoritarian and ridiculous point of view made us angry when i was the target of a great many insults and completely unfair accusations of a large group of people when i was accused of something i had not done a certain person started to say dreadful things very calmly i felt hurt and disgusted my parents were having a typical family argument  i came in and saw the scene and became angry when people harrass me i feel oppressed by their behavior when i learned that several people had died in the street due to  the cold weather when i saw parents punishing their little child for something he had not done  in my opinion even if he had done it he should not have been punished for it  i was with my family and we found some abandoned puppies  i wanted to help them but everyone said no  we then left i had applied for a job and they had assured me that the exams would take place a few months later  a week later i went to obtain some more information and they told me that the exams had already taken place my sister came back home and reproached me for not having tidied up the house although i had been working all morning and she had done nothing when i saw a car run over a child out of carelessness my parents did not let me go on holidays with my friends i sent a book to a friend of mine  the book meant a lot to me and he lost it i gave some personal information to a friend of mine and he told it to some others who were implicated in the affair my mother told me that i could not go to the mountains  despite my age as long as i am in her house i must do what she says  one day i arrived home rather tired and found the house in addition i was asked many questions which i did not want to answer when i got to know about the reaction of a friend of mine in a certain situation  i had not expected him to react that way my mother read a letter that a friend of mine had written to me telling me how she had got drunk the last time my parents scolded me a lot for something i had not done  it was my sister who had done it when an english teacher unfairly made me repeat a semester which i thought i had passed  i had to ask my parents for some more money to carry on studying when my father made my mother go through really terrible situations i felt furious impotent nervous upset  when i found one of my new pullovers wrinkled inside the wardrobe  my brother had done it a friend of mine played a joke on another friend over the telephone  this friend crying called me and i got very angry and made the other person apologize they wanted me to pay for a ticket twice because they said that the one i had was out of date when my aunt told me angrily that i was a goodfornothing and she was fed up with my behaviour my mother and i had an argument over buying some clothes for me  she did not accept the fact that i did not like the same things as her and we ended up shouting at each other i get angry with my brothers and sisters when they do something that i do not like  they know this and still do it so as to tease me one day in a clinic the father of a child came in and assaulted a colleague for something that she had not done deliberately a certain friend tried to push me off a seat in a very violent way for no apparent reason  it may be that he was excited about something when a person the same age as me insisted that i call him mister  i refused to succumb but he persisted and i got angry as he had belittled me when i was accused of having refused to do some hostel work while i was at school  actually i had not been allocated any work when a friend tried to back bite me on false grounds  this made me wonder if he was a really a good friend when i was victimized for running away with a girl who was somebody elses wife and niece at the same time  i was very angry over this issue because i was told to pay him money after having been punished for it

when i saw my car had a flat tire i was stood up for a date function by someone who i really cared for when my dad told me about something he had done against my mother when i failed my ssc exam i was angry at my brother over an argument we had together  we do have a few fights from time to time and also at times i take out my anger on him i felt angry when my motherinlaw did not handle my daughter properly and she fell down from the bed and hurt her head when my father talks about our relatives and favours them i feel angry i was walking on a street alone in the afternoon when there were not too many people on the street  a couple of guys were following me and i was ignoring them  suddenly one of them came in front of me and started using dirty language and harrassing me  i got very angry and wanted to strike back at them  i was angry this morning when i missed the train to university i was to meet a friend at the busstop he was coming to visit us and he did not turn up  after having waited for him for some time     about an hour i called him up to be told that he did not intend to come as he was feeling tired when my friend promised that she would come to my place and did not turn up  i was annoyed at her i was having an argument with my brother on his behavior then we  started fighting and i got annoyed at him because he started teasing me when i failed the msc exams a few months ago when i was teaching i suddenly became very angry at the children and slapped some of them when i was at sybajaj i wanted to get admission in another college and this was not easy and i felt angry  one of my friends asked me to go shopping with her another friend of hers was also coming along  during the outing they kept talking to each other and i felt left out even when i tried to talk to them they seemed not to listen to me and did not pay me much attention i am separated from my husband  the way he has behaved towards me makes me angry a girl whom i trusted and with whom i had shared personal confidential matters twisted the facts and told it to a common friend of ours  when this common friend told me the version my friend had told her i was angry one morning i was standing at the busstop and the bus passed by without stopping even though there were only  passengers inside  i felt angry at the rude behaviour of the bus driver and  conductor i was not given a chance to explain to my close relatives as to why i could not go to visit them when they were ill  when i did go they thought that i had been selfish and irresponsible duringtheir illness uncleaniness at my work place  the place is generally not very clean but when it reaches a point i get angry at the person who is supposed to clean the place and the people who are supposed to supervise him when the others did not do their bit of work on a group assignment task and i had to do all the work when i was insulted by a man when i was blamed for some of my attributes which are very often misunderstood especially when one is very frank when a relative who had come to our place created untidyness and dirtyness my friend and i were to attend a very important meeting and he had promised to come and pick me up  but he did not turn up and i felt very angry at him i was very angry one day when my husband ignored me and slept      on a separate bed  he had no reasons to doubt me or to neglect me and i had never imagined that he could do such a thing i remember that when i was in school i saw a case of partiality  one of the teachers gave private coaching classes to some girls and she would give these girls extra attention in class and would ignore the others  this emotion has never been an intense one that makes it difficult to recall it i experience this emotion quite often but the day i was most angry was the day i got pulled up for something i had not done  it happened during my school days i had not spoken a word in class but the monitor had written my name on the board  so i had a remark in my callender which i had to get signed by my parents  this remark resulted in me being spanked a new gas connection was to be installed and the mechanic who came to do it was very rude to my mother and me  i rushed to thhe dealer with my mother and had a fight with the dealer as he seemed to be unreasonable and was taking the mechanics side  ultimately the matter was resolved after my father went and spoke to him  the mechanic was asked to apologize when i saw a few people beating a man who seemed to be a stranger despite our good performance and excellent results the management refused to meet our demands one day my elder brother badly scolded my father  this was the first time that i heard such abusive language from my brother  i requested him humbly not to use this kind of language but he did not care for what i was saying  finally i picked up an axe to use against him in the meanwhile people intervened when i was doing research a few months ago i had asked the institute to sponsor me for a computer course which was held in tiss  however because of the administrative officer i could not get the money  on discovering the redtapism and the bureaucratic corrupt decadent degenerated infrastucture of every public utility office and service and the rampant corruption at every single level of education and other institutions i felt angry when repeated pleas to the ticket collector and the copassengers in order to make a queue fell on deaf ears  i have this feeling whenever someone is not disciplined and methodic in doing his duty i was travelling from delhi to bombay  i had booked a seat one month back and i had also got a telegram confirming this  however in the train my name had been omitted from the reservation sheet and the one seat that was still vacant was alloted to another person who paid for it despite my requests for the seat  i was allowed to stay in the reserved compartment when i paid money i had made an error in planning a programme and had publicly accepted the mistake despite repeated requests not to bring the matter for discussion a professor kept constantly passing remarks i reacted angrily  a few days back a friend of mine poked me in the ribs for funs sake though i had warned him an infinite number of times that it really hurts me he did it again  i usually ignore this but this time i flared up for a split second and threatened to bash him up  this is the latest incident when i lost my temper though i felt very bad about it later when i was punished in school for no serious mistake of mine one day my roommate started imitating me doing what i had done a few hours back  i got very angry and started beating him up this was the worst incident of my hostel life  i was insulted by a close friend of mine on the eve of the new year and it totally spoiled my new years night once a friend had pushed me and i had fallen on to a window which then broke  i was taken to tthe principals office and he accused me of having broken the window during the short period of my unemployment about six years back when i was dancing with a dame at a social one of my friends who  was interested in her came and took her away from me  i was really angry with him then once i had an argument with my friends and i knew that i was right  my friends went on arguing with me even though they did not know the right thing  during my childhood when i could not get what i wanted from my brothersister and parents  sometime ago i felt very angry when my mother wrote me telling me that my elder sister was messing up things at home by her internalised aggressive attitude towards parents and her husband somebody wanted to beat my brother at a wedding ceremony and i was trying to protect my brother but the other man was calling names to both of us it happened that my brother promised to give me money for school and then he told me that he had failed to fulfil his promise a day before school started

his form five  they do not know what they are doing  they follow every word of their teachers books and systems  they always try to rationalize their bad acts by some game and they are satisfied with their awkward life  i have tried to persuade them very often but have failed  this time i had a fight as they have no voluntary spirit they did not polish the floor i had left a student newspaper of the chinese university on the table of the library  it had disappeared when i came back i had too much homework and examinations and i did not know how to organize my work in the students union there was someone who took the photocopies of two large volumes  i asked him to let me take a few he refused it for an acceptable reason  last week my organization summoned an executive meeting and one of the executive members pointed out a loop hole in the committees administration  he could not suggest any improvements so i quarrelled with him when i was concentrating on my work my friend disturbed me continously  i asked him to stop but in vain i had planned to study for my midterm exams on a certain day and  my roommate called me to ask me to go out for a stroll  i tried to make an excuse so as not to go out but she refused to listen to me and insisted that i go out with her  i find it unnecessary  to talk to her anymore the trick was really intolerable  they hid it and i was worried and restless all day  when i saw them i really wanted to slap each one of them i was scolded by my mother for no reason i had a date with a friend to see a movie and my friend was late  i waited for a long hour and was very angry   before the certificate examination i was very poor in biology the worst result in my class  ever since  it had been getting poorer and poorer  i had tried my best and

them my cassmate laughed at me when i was being scolded by the teacher  when i was studying in the library  preparing for a test two people sitting next to me talked to each other for  minutes  there were no other seats so i could not go elsewhere and i did   not want to interrupt them so i could only be angry in my heart one night i could not practise my violin as my family was watching tv with the lights off so i wanted to listen to some tapes  it was dark so i asked my brother to bring me a torch however he scolded me  i was so angry that i slammed my violin on the floor when i came back to my hostel my bed was full of newspapers and dirty clothes  my roommate asked me to wash the clothes for him as he had no time this was his responsibility  the food we shared had been eaten up by him i ate little my classmate always borrowed my notes and would not return it to me on time  when i had a test she was selfish and irresponsible and so delayed my studies i gave tutorial to a student and i found that he was lazy he did not pay attention to what i taught  he did some easy questions wrong deliberately my classmate used her personal relations to get a seat for a subject that i wanted also  i had taken the pains to help him apply and i did not get selected  i did not like this as he had not told me the facts earlier he need not have lied to me something was stolen my intimate girlfriend told me that her father was opposed to our relationship  and had insulted my integrity someone played a trick on me i worked with several classmates on a project  i was very anxious about the project while my partners showed no concern  and when we had meetings on the project my classmates  did not pay any attention  some of them read books while the others argued on irrelevant questions  the meeting would go on for two hours without the main theme being discussed  we wasted time and could not reach a compromise  my classmates avoided doing the work and the responsibilities they seemed to value other projects more than this one my girlfriend disliked it when i played majong a game of gambling  i expressed my regrets and when i went to see her she neglected my existance  i was very angry and left in displeasure during a football match the other team was rude and they hurt my team members and me  the coach was prejudiced against us and punished us unreasonably  later we fought with each other and the match had to be cut short yesterday i read in the newspaper that a  year old woman had abused her  month old son and had caused his death  i was very angry after reading this as this is not a human act and to abuse so fragile a life is not a forgivable sin  whenever i put myself in others shoes and try to make the person happy comfort him or make friends and i am misunderstood and rejected especially when this person is a family member or a friend when i learnt that a friend of mine had talked about me to another friend and had said wrong things about my abilities and attitudes  i was very angry one day i discussed a very important question with a  a suddenly declared that he would not accept my position and thought that he himself was right  moreover he attacked  strongly not my opinion but me personally once my father slapped my mother for a small quarrel a female classmate was always late for meetings which were for the homework and not social gatherings  we were very busy and the deadline was close but we had to waste half an hour or an hour waiting for her as we could do nothing else then one day i had sunned my favourite shirt and was putting it back in the wardrobe when my younger brother snatched it from me and wore it  he had not had a bath and was very dirty  i scolded him but he answered back and locked himself up in a room  i was very angry so i starteed kicking on the door and abusing him loudly and freely i had a very good friend in secondary school  the year after our graduation i prepared to celebrate her birthday and i called off all my appointments  i got together the other friends and we were ready to give the entire day to her  however this friend disappeared on her birthday  when i phoned another friend i didcovered thay she was busy i did not call her anymore my sister once stole my mothers money and made her very angry  after this my mother would beat her up for unreasonable reasons  one day my sister lent her book to a friend without telling my mother about it  when my mother learnt this she beat her up and even threatened her with a pair of scissors   when i was in  i played a basketball match against another schools team  one of their team members kicked a teammate of mine so i kicked him back and we had a fight with each other i had a date with my girlfriend the time and place had not been fixed  i asked her to phone me an hour later as it was midnight and i did not want to disturb her family  i waited several hours for her call she did not call me that night i was a prefect at secondary school  on the sports day i told others that i would take down the names of the people who misbehaved and after some time i sat down for a brief rest  suddenly the head prefect came and scolded me in front of others  i was very angry as there were other prefects sitting and he picked on me  i thought that a brief rest was not  serious enough to be blamed when i got into a bus i found that my wallet had been stolen it was not a great loss from the monetary point of view but i lost some documents  identity papers  as a result i had to spend several days in order to get a new one  i will always remember all the work i had to do and the bad treatment i suffered because of the bureaucratic behaviour of the civil servant  i had already had bad luck and they treated me like a criminal   at one point of time i really wanted to quarrel with them the day the results of the chinese university was announced i should have been very happy however my grandmother because of  her prejudice and misunderstanding started a  quarrel with my mother  she expected me to take her side and she deliberately talked of my mothers wrong doings  i was very angry because  one my grandmother was not being reasonable and two because it should have been a happy day and three we had moved into a new house that day last week i had planned to play tennis and had booked a tennis court   however when i arrived at the university gym the clerk told me that the court was being used for lessons my friend often played a joke on me and sometimes i thought that he was a nonsensical person once when we went to a friends house he walked in first and shut the door firmly behind him  i felt that he did not respect me and moreover i was his friend so he should not have behaved like that  i was very angry as it is i was in a bad mood then we had fixed time for practice as we had to participate in the interdepartment song contest  i arrived and found that there was nobody there  when i went to the canteen i found them eating lunch  i was so angry that i aired my greviances to one of them and then left whenever my father smokes the smell makes me feel very uncomfortable  he never listens to my complaints and i curse him furiously in my mind  i cannot solve this problem by violence because of traditional moral values   i came across a girl at the school busstop i had seen her several friends as she was a friends friend  however my friend had never introduced me to her and when she got off the bus i smiled at her but she did not respond pretending not to have seen me  her arrogant behaviour made me sick and angry my friend halfteasingly called me a bad nickname  i felt insulted and kicked his hip in anger  i was stable later and did not feel angry at him  in fact i was afraid that the other friends who were with us would think that i was an intolerant person  however i could not apologize so i pretended that nothing had happened and smiled when i left  my friend did not say anything but just watched me leave someone spread rumours about me when i saw that my bed at the hostel was a mess i guessed that someone else had used my daily necessities  i felt that my  personal sanity had been affected the surname of my brother was different from ours  he often grinned at home and provoked others for the pleasure of it  this made me angry in september  i was forced to live with someone i did not like  the first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation was like a debate  the atmosphere was very bad  when he learnt that i had got  marks in a test he told me  a failure you lost  marks   i was very angry not because my marks were lower than his but because i could not tolerate his pride  i did not show my discontentment and carried on doing my work two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her granddaughter  the granddaughter asked me some questions in mathematics so i taught her  however she did not listen to me and this made me feel unhappy  the second year it was the same  when i entered university the girls parents suggested that i be employed as their daghters tutor  they told me that at university  there was no homework and i would have a lot of time so they made a timetable  for me which required me to be the tutor five days a week  they did not respect me and anyway i had another child to teach abhor abhorr abhorrence

accused of something one has not done friends who torture animals when my partner was attacked and lost three teeth unjust accusations directed at me and my way of acting by someone close to me   when i heard on the radio that the football match in belgium had ended in a catastrophe and several people had died  i could not  understand how normal people could behave in such a way at my summer job nobody looked after me in particular and i had to learn all on my own when i spoke to janerik wikstr÷m on the telephone  i locked myself out at work when an elderly man complained unjustifiably about me and distrusted me mad at my dad when someone stole my bike when friends try to put me down or hurt me   when my boyfriend went away for a month long holiday without me at a restaurant i observed how the gypsies tried to get money by cheating the foreigners ie non swedish speaking  my anger had nothing to do with hatred against foreigners but it was an expression of the anger i feel when i see people being used  when i got caught in the pouring rain last thursday and did not have a raincoat on me when a colleague asked me for help at work despite the fact that he had more time to do it than i had the editor changed the heading of an article that i had written  he considered the heading to be derogatory towards the person i had written about on the tv i saw a news feature on south africa  a policeman      attacked a group of black people with a whip we were starting a student project and the teacher we talked to was very negative and not very helpful being treated unfairly i was accused of having done something which i hadnt and got very angry i went to a lecture and once again it had been cancelled this was the second time  one had a negative attitude towards the lecturer in the holiday cottage of our association two of my pals came to wake me up early one morning by bringing a radio played at the highest volume into my room  it was the morning service at its loudest we were in a disco and the evening was not at all pleasant  despite my not knowing why i was angry with my companion  i let him feel my bad humour as i cannot hide my feelings  i sometimes quarrel with my mother because she blames me though i have not in any way been connected to some events two boys whom i know were telling me in an indecent manner how they had teased a young and shy girl i know  they had despised her conviction scorned and touched her  i got very angry and did not try to conceal it and gave it back to them when my tennis match was interrupted because a kid cycled right into the court i had a very heavy work load and two colleagues whom i have nothing against disturbed me by terror ringing ie continously interrupting me by telephoning when i was deputy manager during the summer certain deputies took liberties more than what was normal i reached the bus stop and realized that i had forgotten my bus pass when someone does something wrong which affects me negatively i saw a report on tv news on apartheid in south africa  the time when someone let the air out of the tyres of my cycle  when i missed the tram after having run for it when i am accused of something i have not done i get unbelievably angry someone drove into my car and then denied that it had happened quarrel in the family my car had been towed away by the traffic police because it had been wrongly parked  however the sign had been put up only after i had already parked a colleague asked me for some advice and as he did not have enough confidence in me he asked a third person when close relatives tried to dissuade me from studying psychology because of its low status my employer took too many aspirins for a bad back and also drank an enormous amount of spirit  this was dangerous  and he did not understand that he had done anything wrong the sports fishermen who catch gulls instead of fish with their hooks   it is often a mistake but it makes me angry when i found out that the guy i was dating at a particular time had a steady relationship going on with someone else for a long time when after a week at school a teacher sent a note home saying that my son was inattentive and unable to do his lessons when i was pointed out as a problem child in primary school and my mother took the teachers point of view when my parents drove me to a nearby place and went home immediately instead of waiting a few hours  they could have easily waited when we were in high school a few guys sometimes provoked a friend of mine  they called her a pig and then grunted  this irritated most of the girls  once one of the girls got angry at my friend and said something nasty and this made me terribly angry when my boyfriend sat up half the night playing computer games with a friend when my mother interfered in my life when my father asked me if i was a communist at the same time he made it clear that i should no longer see myself as his daughter when my boss enrolled in a course to satisfy his own ends  to trample on his associates  i have the misfortune to have one of my superiors in my course when my friend as usual forgot the tickets at home for a performance  we missed it when i tried to explain to a plumber face to face that the toilet was broken and he did not believe it it had been mended ten times when i read about reagans tactical decision concerning the south african boycott some noisy guests arrived at the hotel  i had been slightly irritated earlier  at night when i was trying to sleep they were having a party so i went and yelled at them  i wanted to sleep as i had to get up early the next day recently when my sister who is four years younger than me and very spoiled shouted at my mother for no apparent reason   the heartbroken expression on my mothers face made me feel very angry on the way home from marstrand i was driving behind my fathers car  another car tried to push in front of my father and he was forced to swerve and he thus collided the car with a pillar  the other car drove off without even seeing what had happened in a course i thought that i deserved good marks but i only got ordinary marks with no justification as to why i was given these marks when it became clear that a man had used many people sexually and psychologically despite the fact that many people looked up to him  i understood that one could not trust him and i was forced to hide this for a while when after a lot of provocation my child threw a plate on the floor when i was forced to call the telephone company about a bill concerning a disconnected phone belonging to my landlord  the bill was four months overdue and in the meanwhile he had been using my phone he seemed to have no intention of having his own phone reconnected  jealous of my husbands old girlfriend  we met her with her husband and there was a lot of reminiscing exchange of points of view with my sister on a family matter at a cash desk where i had gone to buy  rolls of kitchen paper at a reduced price  after queuing with screaming children it turned out that i had taken two  roll packets instead of the one  roll packet to which the rebate applied  the assistant said you will have to get it another time an unjust refree decision at a sports event when i was the team leader a drummer who had borrowed my drums destroyed both the drumskin and the sticks  he did not repair them nor did he tell me about it when i told off a computer teacher who did not want to teach me beacause of prejudice   when the morning newspaper has not arrived when i argue with my boyfriend i feel as though he feels superior to me when during winter the water pipes froze and we did not have any water for two days when our religion teacher presented shocking sectarian thoughts and dooms day as official teaching in the student kitchen that we share somebody drank from my juice pot one litre so that i only got one glass out of the whole pot i missed the train and had to wait for the next for two hours for this reason i missed an appointment which had been very important for me i was watching tv with a friend after the first film i wanted to watch another film on the same channel my friend switched over to the other cannel without asking me what i wanted i moved to a flat a friend who had lived there before had left the flat in a terrible mess i was very angry about that sloppiness and impudence a friend suggested in a roundabout way that the reason we were late for something was because of me and that im often late i know this was partly true but felt it unjustified that particular time and i felt i couldnt do  anything about it anyway ie being late during a fight with my best friend at my fathers treatment of my mother at his disregard for her and not being committed to her i told my boy friend not to park in a certain place because the car would ger towed away  he didnt listen and it was towed away at that stage our finances were below the poverty line  it cost us   all the money we had to get us through that week including rent getting a terrible exam mark which i couldnt understand the reason for and trying to see a lecturer or tutor but being given the runaround when a close relative is treated badly when my fathers new fiancee treats me like a child  she does not trust me and constantly misunderstands me  i get particularly angry when she says nasty things about my boyfriend with whom she works my parents did not approve my choice of a boyfriend now an exboyfriend  he happened to be  years older than me and he was considered completely unsuitable for me  idiot there was a sofa in my flat which belonged to the old tenants who were acquaintances  it should have been picked up a year ago but they had postponed it  eventually they decided on one date and i stayed at home despite the fact that i had other things to do  they did not come nor did they call and they still have not got in touch with me a girl i was with went off with another guy  my father and i had an argument because i do not help enough at home quarrelled with my younger brother a lady i live with had not bothered to clean up before she went   on holiday i live in a collective  the sight of a man who ran amok fighting at a dance with the job appointments committee when the headmaster in charge explained that a male teacher was more suitable for the particular post  i had more years of service than the male teacher but this was not taken into consideration  i could have been given a less attractive job if things had gone the way the headmaster wanted someone didnt show up at a meeting in spite of having agreed to come when i tried to put up a tent some years ago i was teased and hindered by my cousin a drunken friend of mine was beating up another friend who was also drunk my mother and her friends were speaking badly about my father when they were separated and my brothers and sisters and myself were allowed to listen i was accused of a misdemeanour unjustly meeting generally dominating persons in social occasions when my father phoned me to come home from my vacation since he no longer had the time to look after my garden and animals when my car suddenly broke down  angry with my brother who was making fun of me teasing me being subject to unfair treatment in a working group someone bending the rules was protected by the boss this resulted in more work for the others one of my best friends accused me of giving up to early on problems it was only a casual remark on her side but i was angry and hurt i was subject to false accusations and got very angry i felt unfairly treated at an airport being told to use a different counter for domestic traffic only when students in our working group showed no responsibility or interest in our work my nephew is a deaf and also hyperactive boy i had been responsible for looking after him for a full day and was very tired then he suddenly grabbed a knife and stabbed me in the leg i got so angry that i didnt feel any pain a close friend first said he accepted an agreement but later used that agreement as a reason for attacking me when i tried to breake it up with my boyfriend and he refused to let me go having a fight with a class mate i get angry when people disbelieve me or misunderstand me being a spokesman for the union i got into a quarrel with a colleague who had been acting disloyally over a sustained period of time when others let me down fail to keep agreements i was accused of having drunk a bottle of liquor and then refilling with water when colliding with my car i myself was to blame when my mother treats me as a  old boy having agreed to share the taxi expenses three people in the back of the car just ran off leaving the person up front with the entire bill realizing that a friend had been talked into signing a certain contract receiving personal criticisms early in the morning physical violence a friend wouldnt listen to me i repeatedly tried to warn him to no avail result eight people were pissed off in traffic i often get relatively angry with other drivers several transgressions make me mad especially not yielding to priority traffic eg coming from the right having gone to school without learning anything as usual being slandered by friends angry when our team small boys lost the county championship football final my father accused my brother of having bumped his car and it was wrong i had a discussion with my mother concerning my sisters divorce we disagreed strongly a conflict with a pupil  my fiancee and i were at my parents place watching tv there were  only two tvchairs and we were sitting on them when my drunken brother came in and rudely chased my fiancee off the chair she was sitting on when a

              "  'girl left me while in the army i was treated unfairly by my superiors  i was held responsible for a deed of which i was innocent when stupid people push me during rush time in the city  i had an implicit agreement with my sister about meeting her however she had not understood the situation the same way so she did not turn up when i learned that my brother had spoilt an lp of mine after having quarelled with a relative of mine about politics i was disappointed and angry at the bad quality of a documentay program on tv  in my opinion the topic was important and the program should have been made with seriousness and consideration when i realized that i was far behind the others in the language course and i could no longer catch up with the others i was angry with a friend of mine who behaved in an affected manner when i did not find the rack used for beating up rugs in the yard i had an appointment downtown and the person in question was half an hour late i was coming home in a taxi with a fellow worker of mine  he was criticizing my earlier conduct towards him which to my mind was unfounded  when i reached home i ran out of the taxi and slammed the door a person close to me mistook my good intentions for bad and therefore associated unpleasant traits to me my superior blamed me for some neglects at work in front of others  in fact the task in question was not supposed to be done by me a relative of mine had come to see my husband to talk to him about a problem concerning his sister and me  i was angry because this relative of mine did not dare to speak to me and instead spoke to my husband  i got to know about it later the same day i am a school teacher  one of the classes does not obey me at all keeps on talking does no work  one afternoon everything went wrong and i got exceedingly angry my mother carried on using mental pressure concerning something which was serious and a real burden to me on the tv news i heard that nicaragua had complained about the increasing threat of war with the usa when i checked my examination paper and realized that i had been careless thoughtless lazy and hasty so as to make unnecessary mistakes concerning things i know and understand a member of a religious sect tried to convert me using really evil tricks to persuade me  after he had left i was anxious and angry for a long time after the event i was alone my father had once again told me that i should be careful and try to seek admission to other places also apart from the faculty of social sciences at the university of helsinki  i was not at all interested in any other place and had no time to study for other entrance exams when my roommates were watching videotapes and prevented me from watching the news  the first feeling i had was that i was being treated unfairly and then came the feeling of anger my friends promised me that they would definitely call me to tell me if they were visiting me or not when a friend of mine was drawn into a fight because of the stupid gang he belonged to i felt angry with him and his friends they could not think about anything sensible but would fool around without taking into consideration the feelings of other persons my mother had for some time been trying to separate me from a good friend who she thought was not good company for me  finally at breakfast one day we had an argument and i tried to defend my friend my lifepartner who was drinking more and more spoke about kicking the cat  he had never done anything of the kind but i knew that he would do so one day

to travel next year with another good friend we couldnt talk this out when i got the feeling that i had to do all the housekeeping while my boyfriend didnt do anything this happened in a period of

was not justified my father called me behind my mothers back and told me that my mother disapproved my behavior in the weekend however he didnt tell me the details and left me with unanswered questions when someone does not listen to me after having asked me to repeat what i said this happened more than one time with the same person out on a weekend with a group of people everybody felt irritated because at night the music didnt stop in time and at breakfast my boyfriend ran away because we didnt agree with him i felt angry someone told me that he would stay at my home for one night

in front of the class during a turn a friend told me it would be better for me not to be on familiar terms with another friend although in my opinion he had no reason to say such things he only said so hoping that i would search support from him that however was not necessary i had made an appointment with three friends we had to go out together when i arrived at the place the other persons werent there i became very angry because i thought they were gone without me that however didnt appear to be the case a classmate urged me to carry out a particular protest along with him and when the time came this fellow drew back while i had to face the situation when i first saw a person begging we hitch hiked our way back from a town rather drunk  we were dropped in another town which was unknown to us  i needed to urinate so i did it on a wall which turned out to belong to the military headquarters  they arrested me and made me pay a fine of  pts  we had to go home on foot  km since

some children hunting a cat to death when i was told that a boy did not want to be my friend without any apparent reason i had an argument with my mother because i criticized the rules she imposes at

intervention which made me feel uncomfortable when my father addressed me directly and maliciously thus including me in the family war a murder during an argument between friends one of them accused me of taking advantage of some other friends who usually come to the university in my car saying that i ask them too much money for the petrol my cousins were playing at home and one of them broke a decorative object which was very precious to me during a family discussion on my future and my prospects as a student they accused me of not bothering about looking for a job to assume my financial

after drinking a glass of water i found a cockroach walking out of the glass we were at school in the room for audiovisual classes  we were watching a film and just behind me two classmates were bothering me with their mocking and shoves  i reacted angrily i suppose  by hitting one of them during my last exam on the occasion of assignment of tasks and responsibilities in which such an assignment dispropotionately carried with it high responsibility and low ability of organisation and resolution when they broke the artistic work of several weeks  changes were made and it was broken without permission they had no right to do this in a confrontation with a person he provoked me several times till i reacted in an angry way  fortunately there were no disastrous consequences when i

way my mother read a letter that a friend of mine had written to me telling me how she had got drunk the last time my parents scolded me a lot for something i had not done  it was my sister who had done it when an english teacher unfairly made me repeat a semester which i thought i had passed  i had to ask my parents for some more money to carry on studying when my father made my mother go

it so as to tease me one day in a clinic the father of a child came in and assaulted a colleague for something that she had not done deliberately a certain friend tried to push me off a seat in a very violent way for no apparent reason  it may be that he was excited about something when a person the same age as me insisted that i call him mister  i refused to succumb but he persisted and i got angry as he had belittled me when i was accused of having refused to do some hostel work while i was at school  actually i had not been allocated any work when a friend tried to back bite me on false grounds  this made me wonder if he was a really a good friend when i was victimized for running away with a girl who was somebody elses wife and niece at the same time  i was very angry over this

out of the house at  am monday morning getting ready t go to school and fight for a parking when i saw my car had a flat tire i was stood up for a date function by someone who i really cared for when

times i take out my anger on him i felt angry when my motherinlaw did not handle my daughter properly and she fell down from the bed and hurt her head when my father talks about our relatives and favours them i feel angry i was walking on a street alone in the afternoon when there were not too many people on the street  a couple of guys were following me and i was ignoring them  suddenly one of them came in front of me and started using dirty language and harrassing me  i got very angry and wanted to strike back at them  i was angry this morning when i missed the train to university i was to meet a friend at the busstop he was coming to visit us and he did not turn up  after having waited for him for some time     about an hour i called him up to be told that he did not intend to come as he was feeling tired when my friend promised that she would come to my place and did not turn up  i was annoyed at her i was having an argument with my brother on his behavior then we  started fighting and i got annoyed at him because he started teasing me when i failed the msc exams a few months ago when i was teaching i suddenly became very angry at the children and slapped some of them when i was at sybajaj i wanted to get admission in another college and this was not easy and i felt angry  one of my friends asked me to go shopping with her another friend of hers was also coming along  during the outing they kept talking to each other and i felt left out even when i tried to talk to them they seemed not to listen to me and did not pay me much attention i am separated from my husband  the way he has behaved towards me makes me angry a girl whom i trusted and with whom i had shared personal confidential matters twisted the facts and told it to a common friend of ours  when this common friend told me the version my friend had told her i was angry one morning i was standing at the busstop and the bus passed by without stopping even though there were only  passengers inside  i felt angry at the rude behaviour of the bus driver and  conductor i was not given a chance to explain to my close relatives as to why i could not go to visit them when they were ill  when i did go they thought that i had been selfish and irresponsible duringtheir illness uncleaniness at my work place  the place is generally not very clean but when it reaches a point i get angry at the person who is supposed to clean the place and the people who are supposed to supervise him when the others did not do their bit of work on a group assignment task and i had to do all the work when i was insulted by a man when i was blamed for some of my attributes which are very often misunderstood especially when one is very frank when a relative who had come to our place created untidyness and dirtyness my friend and i were to attend a very important meeting and he had promised to come and pick me up  but he did not turn up and i felt very angry at him i was very angry one day when my husband ignored me and slept      on a separate bed  he had no reasons to doubt me or to neglect me and i had never imagined that he could do such a thing i remember that when i was in school i saw a case of partiality  one of the teachers gave private coaching classes to some girls and she would give these girls extra attention in class and would ignore the others  this emotion has never been an intense one that makes it difficult to recall it i experience this emotion quite often but the day i was most angry was the day i got pulled up for something i had not done  it happened during my school days i had not spoken a word in class but the monitor had written my name on the board  so i had a remark in my callender which i had to get signed by my parents  this remark resulted in me being spanked a new gas connection was to be installed and the mechanic who came to do it was very rude to my mother and me  i rushed to thhe dealer with my mother and had a fight with the dealer as he seemed to be unreasonable and was taking the mechanics side  ultimately the matter was resolved after my father went and spoke to him  the mechanic was asked to apologize when i saw a few people beating a man who seemed to be a stranger despite our good performance and excellent results the management refused to meet our demands one day my elder brother badly scolded my father  this was the first time that i heard such abusive language from my brother  i requested him humbly not to use this kind of language but he did not care for what i was saying  finally i picked up an axe to use against him in the meanwhile people intervened when i was doing research a few months ago i had asked the institute to sponsor me for a computer course which was held in tiss  however because of the administrative officer i could not get the money  on discovering the redtapism and the bureaucratic corrupt decadent degenerated infrastucture of every public utility office and service and the rampant corruption at every single level of education and other institutions i felt angry when repeated pleas to the ticket collector and the copassengers in order to make a queue fell on deaf ears  i have this feeling whenever someone is not disciplined and methodic in doing his duty i was travelling from delhi to bombay  i had booked a seat one month back and i had also got a telegram confirming this  however in the train my name had been omitted from the reservation sheet and the one seat that was still vacant was alloted to another person who paid for it despite my requests for the seat  i was allowed to stay in the reserved compartment when i paid money i had made an error in planning a programme and had publicly accepted the mistake despite repeated requests not to bring the matter for discussion a professor kept constantly passing remarks i reacted angrily  a few days back a friend of mine poked me in the ribs for funs sake though i had warned him an infinite number of times that it really hurts me he did it again  i usually ignore this but this time i flared up for a split second and threatened to bash him up  this is the latest incident when i lost my temper though i felt very bad about it later when i was punished in school for no serious mistake of mine one day my roommate started imitating me doing what i had done a few hours back  i got very angry and started beating him up this was the worst incident of my hostel life  i was insulted by a close friend of mine on the eve of the new year and it totally spoiled my new years night once a friend had pushed me

knew that i was right  my friends went on arguing with me even though they did not know the right thing  during my childhood when i could not get what i wanted from my brothersister and parents  sometime ago i felt very angry when my mother wrote me telling me that my elder sister was messing up things at home by her internalised aggressive attitude towards parents and her husband somebody wanted to beat my brother at a wedding ceremony and i was trying to protect my brother but the other man was calling names to both of us it happened that my brother promised to give me money for

the names of the people who misbehaved and after some time i sat down for a brief rest  suddenly the head prefect came and scolded me in front of others  i was very angry as there were other prefects sitting and he picked on me  i thought that a brief rest was not  serious enough to be blamed when i got into a bus i found that my wallet had been stolen it was not a great loss from the monetary point of view but i lost some documents  identity papers  as a result i had to spend several days in order to get a new one  i will always remember all the work i had to do and the bad treatment i suffered because of the bureaucratic behaviour of the civil servant  i had already had bad luck and they treated me like a criminal   at one point of time i really wanted to quarrel with them the day the results of the chinese university was announced i should have been very happy however my grandmother because of  her prejudice and misunderstanding started a  quarrel with my mother  she expected me to take her side and she deliberately talked of my mothers wrong doings  i was very angry because  one my grandmother was not being reasonable and two because it should have been a happy day and three we had moved into a new house that day last week i had planned to play tennis and had booked a tennis court   however when i arrived at the university gym the clerk told me that the court was being used for lessons my friend often played a joke on me and sometimes i thought that he was a nonsensical person once when we went to a friends house he walked in first and shut the door firmly behind him  i felt that he did not respect me and moreover i was his friend so he should not have behaved like that  i was very angry as it is i was in a bad mood then we had fixed time for practice as we had to participate in the interdepartment song contest  i arrived and found that there was nobody there  when i went to the canteen i found them eating lunch  i was so angry that i aired my greviances to one of them and then left whenever my father smokes the smell makes me feel very uncomfortable  he never listens to my complaints and i curse him furiously in my mind  i cannot solve this problem by violence because of traditional moral values   i came across a girl at the school busstop i had seen her several friends as she was a friends friend  however my friend had never introduced me to her and when she got off the bus i smiled at her but she did not respond pretending not to have seen me  her arrogant behaviour made me sick and angry my friend halfteasingly called me a bad nickname  i felt insulted and kicked his hip in anger  i was stable later and did not feel angry at him  in fact i was afraid that the other friends who were with us would think that i was an intolerant person  however i could not apologize so i pretended that nothing had happened and smiled when i left  my friend did not say anything but just watched me leave someone spread rumours about me when i saw that my bed at the hostel was a mess i guessed that someone else had used my daily necessities  i felt that my  personal sanity had been affected the surname of my brother was different from ours  he often grinned at home and provoked others for the pleasure of it  this made me angry in september  i was forced to live with someone i did not like  the first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation was like a debate  the atmosphere was very bad  when he learnt that i had got  marks in a test he told me  a failure you lost  marks   i was very angry not because my marks were lower than his but because i could not tolerate his pride  i did not show my discontentment and carried on doing my work two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her granddaughter  the granddaughter asked me some questions in mathematics so i taught her  however she did not listen to me and this made me feel unhappy  the second year it was the same  when i entered university the girls parents suggested that i be employed as their daghters tutor  they told me that at university  there was no homework and i would have a lot of time so they made a timetable  for me which required me to be the tutor five days a week  they did not respect me and anyway i had another child to teach abhor abhorr abhorrence abomin abominate abomination aggrav aggravate aggravated

friend once reacted childishly he is  yearrs old to my not responding in his favour to a request that is he asked me for some money i refused and his reaction was quite childish at a social event when none of the guests would help to serve food or clear tables it was all beneath them a colleague and i were sitting on a bench next to an old man in a shopping centre the old man coughed and spluttered somewhat then with his fingers removed the resultant phlegm and mucous from his mouth and transferred it onto the armrest of the bench when i heard about the way a parent of a friend had mistreated him and caused a great instability disgust at a girl i know for continually feeling sorry for herself and never acting positively to do something about her problems i realised that someone was

party celebrating a friends  birthday  upon leaving i found  people outside throwing up and further  unconscious we had friends to dinner and one of them threw a beer bottle in the air and it bounced on an expensive table and damaged the table the person did not apologise discovering a good friend had lied to me resulting in a detrimental relationship with another person when i found out some family friends were embezzelling the company they worked for  using company petrol and food supplies and claiming furniture and crockery someone ruining someones property just for the fun of it was picking up my father from work and on passing through the valley watched three prostitutes walk up and down waiting for someone to pick them up clothing was disgusting when i heard that one of my good friends when at a party had got herself involved with some very undesirable characters and was experimenting with drugs while watching a film of an experimental operation on a cats brain in which the cat had metal pieces protruding from its eyes mouth etc to keep the head stable while being cut open at school when the only thing people my age could think of was getting rolling drunk they couldnt have a good time without firstly getting drunk during the py  film session on tuesday one of the films shown  was of an experiment on a live cat involving strapping it into a machine for possibly days and doing things to its brain at a party where the boys were telling revolting stories about the girls theyd been with at my father when he yelled and accused my sisters friend over the phone of doing something he didnt do or know anything about a situation where i ignored my beliefs and principles for a trip of whimsy hearing of a filthy situation over the phone at a night club watching little

they are in canada my roommate talking and shaking her bed at night some boys boasting about their ability to tell dirty jokes finding out some people had been talking about me at my back talking to someone i disliked a relative not acting on her promise postgraduate students talking about girls stupid i had been forced to get together with strange and disgusting classmates  the things they talked about disgusted me and made me feel ill at ease  i knew that i would feel unhappy if i stayed there but i was defeated by the social norms someone who was sitting very close to me was smoknig in the compartment of an air conditioned minibus because of the examination i had to study night and day i greeted a friend and he did not respond i was sitting in the bus and a man with a very unpleasant smell came and sat next to me to top it all he smoked continously when i was talking to a person who is a hypocrite i felt disgusted at his reaction once when i had started to write a paper there was a phone call for me  i had to go downstairs to receive it and after the conversation i discovered that all the information had disappeared from my mind knowing that i had to do the survey with him i felt very reluctant  although i do not know him i feel disgusted by just looking at him  thinking that the project lasted several days i regreted having joined that project when i dined with my new friends one of them kept reminding us that he was superior during the chinese lessons a student often showed off moreover he misbehaved and dressed very badly  so disgusting  one day when i was sitting in a not very crowded bus a middle  aged woman was standing beside me  the person sitting next to me got up to get off and this woman pushed me and occupied the seat  then she took off her shoes and put her feet on the seat i am disgusted by people who spoil their identity because of misbehaviour  this morning when i was in a crowded bus i found a seat on which a university student was sitting on one side and he had put his bag and files next to him  there was very little space left and i sat down while he kept on reading  even when i leaned on him he did not put his bag away  he did not respond and i felt very angry in secondary school i had a classmate who talked too much   once we went to the cinema after school and she sat next to me and commented the movie throughout   very disgusting i felt disgusted on seeing my boyfriend after our separation  one day he was begging at the mass transit railway station and at that moment i hated him i was an instructior in a youth organization  whenever we the instructors would have a meeting the advisor would be present  he did not understand our worknig conditions but talked a lot and had a lot of outdated ideas  whenever we disagreed with him he was very discontent and said that we had a prejudice against him  why did he have to treat us as his subordinates  my girlfriend lost her temper without any reason and she did not consider or respect my feelings i hate the behaviour of my so called friends they use bad language spit boast and treat the youngsters badly when i was a teacher in an evening school a girl raised a lot of questions and expressed her opinions  she very often took a stand which was different from mine and she thought that it was better than mine  her opinions were helpful academically but  she did not take into consideration my position in public  also she seemed to be very talkative and so she disgusted me when i was travelling to school by bus i went past a place where a sewer had been repaired  there was a bad strong smell which suffocated me and i wanted to leave the place immediately at the crowded conditions of living  i always quarrel with my elder brother as he puts the tv volume at a deafening level and i can not practise my piano lessons  thus i feel that my home is disgusting when i was giving private tutorials to my student he would not concentrate and was lazy  he had not done the home work that i  had assigned and his academic level was very low  it was a nuisance when i was studying and someone disturbed me our neighbour came and gossiped about others with my parents during a recent meeting mr a showed his excitement and overindulged in the notes delivered  though his curiosity could not be blamed his way of accquiring knowledge was an extreme behaviour eg he always tried to know what i was reading and gained everything he could when the summer holiday job was almost over the behaviour of people spitting everywhere it was a narrow and dirty passage which was located near the market and i had to stand there to wait for people in a study group a person always liked to argue on some unimportant irrelevant and minor points  he tried to persuade    others in an unfriendly way  he was obstinate and would not accept  others point of view my classmate got a b for his homework while i only got a c  when we got the results he acted as if he did not merit this grade  i found that his humility was hypocritical and i found it disgusting a  group of youngsters dressed in fads talked foul language on a bus  they also insulted the  pedestrians on the road and were impolite to the passengers of the bus a tiresome person held me up all day long  i was very busy then i can not remember what the problem was  he continously tried to make me talk to him and disturbed me when i saw a lot of rubbish and animal waste on the floor once while studying for my exam i found so many complicated words that it disgusted me  i would classify subjectively a certain gesture or the way of talking of a person as disgusting or inacceptable i used to play with a group of classmates and i found out later that they were cheap in thought behaviour and conduct  they would smoke fight and speak foul language  i thought that they destroyed the image of college students when i was studying in the library a pair of lovers were sitting next to me talking in an intense and soft voice  they were disturbing others my boyfriend and i did not have any contact with each other during  the summer holidays  i met him the day of the registration and looked  through him  in the canteen he asked me if i wanted to have a drink and  i said no as i did not want him to do me a favour a brother from one of the christian fellowship often phoned me and talked to me for half an hour or more  however there was nothing important in the conversation and i found the person very disgusting my mother was always fastidious about my room bed time etc  she treated us strictly and punished us physically   these things were intolerable once at a camp a classmate criticized me in front of others  now i find that this classmate is very disgusting i made friends with a classmate whose behaviour i did not like  he tried to flatter other people and did not respect me i had joined a youth group that observed the affairs of our community and so i had many opportunities to contact the government and the committee members of the district board a local executive structure  we always tried to consult and discuss with them but we found that such people did not understand community affairs and they even dampened our enthusiasm in local affairs  i did not understand why they had decided to work as community leaders a few days back i walked on a heap of faeces while walking on the road  i got goose flesh because of this during these summer vacations a schoolmate who was not in my class went to britain  before he left his classmates and some of us who were accquainted with him had a bbq on the beach  when i arrived i saw that some people  who were not close friends of the departing personperson a were playing mahjong  some others were playing bridge and a had nothing to do besides it was a who had prepared the food  later when we wanted to talk and his classmates did not even have the decency to listen to him  they only asked him a few questions halfheartedly and then they talked on their own  some of their conversation was against me and  another classmate a few days back i was waiting for the bus at the bus stop  before getting into the bus i had prepared the exact amount of coins to pay for the bus fair and when i got into the bus i put these coins into the box meant to collect the bus fair  i thought that i had paid and wanted to get inside  however the bus driver called me and asked me in an impolite way if the coins were stuck at the opening  of the box  he had not seen me paying and there wasnt a stack of coins in the box  i could not understand this and the driver kept questioning me  he made me feel angry and at last i inserted a dollar coin in the box just to get away from him  later i found that i had forgotten a few coins in my pocket and had not paid enough for the fair the first time  after i had entered the bus i could still hear him scolding me and i felt disgusted i had a friend who was very kind to me  i tried my best to like him and understand him but when i was with him i could not help rejecting criticizing and blaming him  i wanted to get away from him as soon as possible a friend told me that a boy wanted to get to know me  at that time i felt disgusted and thought that it was a nonsense thing my friend and i worked for the community centre by holding a booth  one day my friend went off to another booth to play  this meant that i was very busy and could not maintain order  his behaviour disgusted me when my roommate and i had dinner together we decided as to who would clean the bowls  one day when i came back from school i found that she had not cleaned up  since i had to cook dinner i cleaned them myself and felt unhappy and disgusted whenever i spoke to a female classmate i felt disgusted  she said meaningless things and seemed to indicate something to me but i did not lovelike her the curriculum of the year    the english course was very heavy  i had not prepared and the teacher asked several questions during class  the students were not ready to answer the questions and the teacher was frustated a man sexually aggressed a small girl in the bus but the girl did not dare to speak out at hostel my roommate was a very selfish person and would avoid doing anyhting that did not concern him  a few of us prepared lunch together and had decided to share the work  my roomate had promised to do the same but i had to wash the bowls everytime after dinner  i tried to wait and thought that he would realize his fault  i did not want to tell him to do the work as he is a university student and ought to have selfrespect  he disappointed me and so every time i saw him i tried to avoid him and did not want to keep any contact with him my roommate liked to listen to some meaningless songs which had melody but had no content  we lived together so when he played the recorder i was forced to listen to them  i could not tell him that i did not like to listen to the songs as i had no right to disturb the freedom of others  so i would find a pretext to leave the room and go somewhere else i was at home and i heard a loud sound of spitting outside the door  i

someone and that person arrives late in the meantime one starts thinking about all that could have gone wrong eg a traffic accident when i climbed up a tree to pick apples  the angle of the ladder i was on did not enable me to get high enough  this implied that the ladder was not very stable when my  year old son climbed up and sat on the  floor balcony with his legs hanging out  he was holding on tightly to the upper railing of the balcony but he could have easily lost his balance when he sat down it was winterspring and the ice was melting  i was far out on a jetty and i poked the ice with a long branch to try and break it  the branch went through the ice and i fell in the water closed in over my head when as a child i was nearly knocked down by a car a bus drove over my right leg  the event itself was not very frightening but when i had to wait in the emergency ward for three hours and then my leg began to swell i was frightened in a cottage in a large forest i was alone for a while in the dark on the way back from denmark with a friend on a small yatch there was a storm and my friend was blown overboard  i was very scared till i managed to get him back onboard when i am out in the dark and a suspicious looking character comes towards me on the way home one friday night in the heavy rain the car acquaplanned  i lost contact with the road surface for a few seconds when i flew from athens to copenhagen after a holiday  the plane was caught in a storm and it began to shake and i thouhght that we were going to crash when i could not find my  year old daughter  i ran

exit while taking a short cut through the vasa park i was surrounded by three people who tried to steal my money  i was scared and was saved only by the appearance of other people when my father was ill and was waiting for the results of his tests when i found out that my father had lung cancer and they did not know how long he would live when i was stopped by plain clothes policemen because the car i was driving had overturned on the avenue  i had been driving too fast and i was afraid when i was stopped questionned and then toild to go  the situation ended happily since there were no consequences i met intoxicated people with dubious intentions in a back alley one wednesday night when my sister had the still born child she was emotionally very deep down and it took her a long time to recover i wandered by mistake into the safety zone of a shooting range and was shot at when i was the first to arrive at the scene after an accident and found that a close school friend had been killed i was alone at home in bed reading a womens magazine in which there were storiees of paranormal experiences  my leg was itching and i stretched my hand to scratch and i felt another strange hand later i realized that it was the corner of the blanket i went to practice in sweden during summer and i was afraid that i would not do well our tutorial group was soon to be divided and we got a list of names of freshmen out of which five were to be in my group  we read the names and then each group went its own way to a seminar room  i wondered how i would cope with the new situation and if i would succeed as a group leader i felt fear of the purest kind after a car accident  the incident and images of horror kept coming back to my mind  i wondered what could have happened to my sister

use the emergency brakes when my husband and i spent a night by ourselves in a house which was in an area on the outskirts of a large town with which we were  not familiar  we  heard strange noises

school we told each other horror stories and suddenly we heard uncanny noises i was terribly frightened one evening my father told me to go into the cellar and get him a beer i was terribly frightened at the idea of a man sitting in the cellar and assaulting me for my defence i took an empty bottle with me one night i was lying in my bed awake but i had my eyes closed i saw figures with terrible faces and black frocks bending over me and touching me i opened my eyes but i could still see them i had the feeling that somebody was in the room it was terrible only when i turned on the light i was able to go to sleep i was skiing with friends and they wanted to skijump i did not want to be left behind so i braced myself and followed them i had to go to the dentists when he touched my tooth with

and hardly was able to sleep when i was  years old my tonsils had to be operated on this is not a complicated operation but just before it started i was very afraid so that i will never forget it i was in a dark cellar and saw a glowing red point i thought that it was a person with a cigarette  but it was only the red switch i studied medicine for several semesters and at that time i developed a great fear of examinations i was most afraid of my examination of anatomy while other students were examined i was dissecting i was able to hear everything and was waiting with fear until it was my turn my first public appearance in front of a rathe big audience before an examination i had the fealing that i had not learned enough i had climbed on a cherry tree alone and there was a thick caterpillar beside my fingers i feel disgusted by caterpillars and snakes i was terribly afraid of the caterpillar crawling on my fingers out of the fear i was almost unable to climb down after a footballmatch i went home by car a friend drove i did not realize that he was drunk until we were in the car he was madly racing several times we were in dangerous situations and i told him to be cautious but he did not care after my boyfriend had beaten me for the first time i always trembled when somebody knocked on my door or when i heard steps coming nearer my mother my sister and i were sitting in the sitting room and watching a film on tv my father came home drunk and told us to turn off when we did not do that he switched off the fuse and started shouting we were sitting in the dark and i was afraid that he would do us a harm when we had swimming instruction we had to take a header from the springboard i usually refused to do that but at least i was forced to i lived in a flat with a couple the woman was so jealous of me that she sometimes had crying fits eventually her husband could not stand that any more and wanted to kill me before my final examination before i went to the urologists i was afraid for several reasons because it was for the first time because the medical checkup might be painful because of the uncertainty and because someone had informed me about it i was afraid before i went to the doctors when i had my first oral examination after a long time especially one day before the examination when i had the feeling that i had not studied enough and had not enough time to make up for it when i had to go through lonely streets in the middle of the night i got lost in a foreign town i did not know the language of that country and it took me hours to meet my friends again after a motor accident i was the frongseatpassenger i spit blood my fear appeared in the form of jealousy i was afraid that my girlfriend had fallen in love with another man i was afraid to lose her when i wanted to go into a house there was suddenly a big dog standing beside me it was hardly moving but i did not know how it would react later on i was awakened by a dream in the middle of the night i dreamt that a stranger was in my house recently my younger brother disappeared for two days without leaving a trace usually he tells me when he wants to do something like that therefore i was afraid that something had happened to him before an oral examination  which i did not take eventually unknown person knocking repeatedly on backdoor when no one else was at home movement in bush late at night while camping a car came very close to hitting me whilst i was crossing the street before giving a seminar to a rather large audience i was a passenger in a jumbojet which was accelerating down the runway and almost at the point of takeoff when the pilot suddenly braked and put the engines into reverse thrust in an obviously urgent attempt to stop the aircraft the hostesses show signs of concern and my first thought was that something was on the runway in our path and that we were in danger of hitting it when i heard that there had been some women raped at uni just near where i usually park my car and walk by myself at night although i wasnt in danger it unnerved me for days and i was fearful whenever walking through the area i was walking home late at night from lectures and someone deliberately started following me it was dark and i was scared i do not recall being scared in the near past when my mother was angry with me over my friends and boyfriend a workmate and i had been antagonistic with each other for some weeks  he had reacted violently to my criticisms of his work standards after going through a glass door i sustained a number of serious cuts which were gaping open when my boyfriend was leaving to go home one night i had a very deep sense of uneasiness and an unwarranted fear that i wouldnt see him again i was on my surf ski rather large waves to strong current separated me from my ski and we both began to drift slowly actually rather quickly away to sea the direction i was drifting in was taking me straight over a reef on which rather large sharks were constantly being caught i was alone with no one to help me my brother and i were driving to brisbane when he drove back onto the road perhaps cutting off another car but not noticeable  this driver did his best to drive us off the road for about  an hour fear of sexual overtures from a close relative in the family i was walking to my car at night and thought that i was being followed stranded in the north of fraser island with a submerged  wd hire vehicle taking a trip to crocokile country i fell out of the boat and was motivated by fear of being eaten to perform great swimming feats when at school i threw a duster at another child and hit him in the head the blow caused a flesh wound and i was afraid of what would happen to me when the teacher found out the circumstances as a child ie  hiking in reasonably rugged bush and becoming lost for a duration of  hours car accident travelling as a passenger along narrow bitumen road at night  trying to overtake semitrailer the truck pulled over onto our side and we hit the wet dirt swerved back into the truck back onto the verge over a guide post and into a ditch walking along with a dog

holiday walking back to where i was staying at night and two men started closely following me there was nobody around that i could run to first day at university i didnt know what to expect going to a disco by myself to wait for some friends we had separated and hadnt planned where to meet i wasnt sure if they were even going to this place so i felt very conscious of being alone when cleaning up a pile of junk under our house a huge spider a jungle spider ran out near me i do not like even small spiders a man was yelling outside my window at  am yelling threats though not to me walking around

caught in an elevator and it got stuck between floors when somebody broke into our home one night when my mother was out and my sister and i had just gone to bed i was seven years old and swimming outside the flags at the gold coast i was caught in a rip and taken out about  m i couldnt swim too well but an older friend  swam out and saved me walking in the dark by myself every time i see a spider or a snake left alone in dark when young when i dreamed that i was being attacked by a friend i felt fear when once i was asleep and dreamed that i was dying asfixiated by a cardiac attack i

sisters and brothers  were young i was sitting on the bus coming back from school a man from nearly forty years sat beside me after a while i looked at him and saw that he was looking at me with opened throusers and holding his penis once when i crossed the street and was nearly trampled by a car passing by car over a bridge where only one car could pass there was a precipice on both sides no protection grilles and the bridge was completely muddled the day that there was a blackout in the city and i was in an exposition i felt fear that something more serious was happening like a revolution for example the week before i entered to army when we were being selected during  days i had to pass  hours a day waiting for the answer which at last was the worst the fear of being convoked of hearing the fated phrase was constant one day when i realized that i was alone i felt fear of loneliness when i saw a horror film i had an important amount of money with me and felt fear

very quiet and very dark when i was ringing up a guy who was my teen idol and was in auckland i was really scared i didnt know what to say or do when i nearly caused a traffic accident with my car walking at friday night through nijmegen going to a pub or a disco i felt fear when my mother was heavily ill i felt it at the same time when i felt disgust i experienced this feeling when the doctors found a nodule in one of my mothers breasts it turned out to be an occlusion resulting from continious sucking but for a few days i was not in my reason i was to be given an audition to get a role i had a competitress and i wasnt well prepared because i was ill once i was alone at home i suddenly felt unwell and there was no one to help me and call first aid when diving deep into the sea to reach the floor i felt breathless i was cautious but i doubted i should be able to come to the surface and inhale one fears many things for example one fears going to the dentist but as far as i am concerned this feeling is connected with the examination session having a car accident i experienced it once when we were on a drive our car passed by the one comming from the opposite direction at an incredibly small distance i felt it when i sat for my exam in anatomy a friend of mine gave birth to a child very dangerous delivery i was afraid for her and for the baby few years ago my father was very ill he stayed at a hospital for a long time then i experienced that terrible feeling that i might lose him in the real sense of the word i experienced fear in my first months in the army during my first night of duty the cause for all this was a bear i became panic sticken may be for the first time and even forgot that i had a gun can think of no time that i have felt fear i was in the korean war we were attacked with mortars me and companion we stopped the jeep and ran for cover fortunately neither of us was hit but we both came close to being killed while tramping on a narrow path two of us were confronted by a woman with two snarling dogs demanding we get off the property  via a flooded river  i was attacked standing in a doorway by a pack of  dogs alsatians and farm dogs with my escape route blocked by a shut fence when confronted and in my opinion hassled by the police when for example my grandfather fell seriously ill it was necessary for him to be operated and i felt great fear of losing him because he is so dear to me the last time i felt it was when i was coming home late at night fear of the loss of a close friend of feeling the ground slipping from under my feet if a close relatives life is in danger before an examination i felt a physical fear if i can call it this way today in the bus where i was sitting on the first seat while turning the driver didnt see the tram which was making a dash towards us coming from the side i was and whose driver intended to cross in yellow light this feeling i sensed quite recently it was arisen by the terrific thought that i might lose the man i loved  i had to have my tonsils out i had been making up my mind almost for a year  i was afraid but during the two hours in the hospital room while i was waiting to be called for the operation i felt a real fear  of the pain of what they were going to do to me of the unknown i felt this feeling when one day my landlords cat had crept under my bed and i couldnt cope with it during an hour and a half one evening i was watching the news on tv again they were talking about the danger of war suddenly i imagined what it might mean for me for my friends for the people close to me i felt it a very near and possible event i broke my knee when i was skiing over yastrebetz a racing track in a bulgarian winter resort i felt fear once when the car in which i travelled directed towards the precipice along the road when i broke my leg i felt fear in a dam lake when the water was let flow to water the plants and i and two other boys were near the water pit we rescued ourselves only thanks to the flippers and the tyre that was with us i was alone in my room at the boarding house when at  oclock someone knocked violently on the door i was going to knock down a pedestrian with my car the night before my wife had given birth to our twins i felt fear in the hospital yard i feared if everything was going to be in order a fear from the loss of a close friend as a result of his behavior i felt fear when i sat for one of my exams though my fear was not quite justifiable i still remember about it a fear of lack of personal powers because of a conflict with my parents there was a possibility to interrupt my studies before an exam in logics i bet that i would jump down from a window i was sure that i would jump but before i did it i rather felt fear i had a car accident before going to the dentist when i have to go in for an exam and the examinor is a person with a whimsical character and unsteady requirements i am afraid before an exam or colloquium one evening a friend of mine was telling a fearful story nobody took it seriously but i got frightened few days ago i really experienced fear it was connected with unexpected actions on the part of a group of people this evoked in me many negative emotions i was a bit frightened when it was found that there was something wrong with my liver however it turned out that it was not serious and i need not worry fear overwhelmed me when right against the car i was in i saw another one as if out of control of the driver two years ago i saw a film on the tv even now it makes me afraid i felt something close to that when i saw that there was a man on the terrace of the flat i was at the seaside and my brother disappeared for a couple of hours once as a child i dreamed of a fire since that time i hadnt wanted to sleep in that bed and had feared the night darkness and so it is now i was walking on the pavement when a white car rolled on it and directed towards me i was quite near the house wall when it rolled by and hit me i had worries about a certain illness this was what i felt when my boyfriend went to bourgas to study there i had the feeling i would lose him anyway the distance plovdivbourgas seemed to me so great fear when fulfilling my obligations on my first night fatigue duty as a soldier fear from the unknown i felt fear when i sat for the entrance examinations students fear many things but we seem to fear the examinations most of all i remember i w',\n",
              "  'as horror stricken before my microbiology exam because it was a decisive one i fear before each exam it was not long ago when i and two of friends of mine got quite drunk and one of them began to rave under the influence of the alcohol i felt fear of what could have happened i felt fear when i fell down and broke my leg into pieces and i could not feel it at all i feel fear quite

badly injured in an accident when i failed my first exam at the higher institute i was terrified during an axcursion in italy i was lost and left alone in this unfamiliar country when i first sat for an entrance examination watching a horror movie with friends walking home at night after university  part of the way there are ano lights and i am walking down a thoroughfare with the thouth of no one hearing me if i have to scream i had to tell someone that i was interested in remaining celibate and alone and that my spiritual master strictly prohibited sexual relations outside of marriage this

the examiners room i blew it   i was so nervous i couldnt reply easily  it was very important but i got only blankness a truck big one nearly mowed me off the road i was driving a small lazer when my

very scared when he told me this story when i went up the stairs in a high dark house full of shadows passed a door and had the feeling that someone or something was behind me although i knew i was alone my grandmother several times has been struck by cerebral hemorrhages until now she recovered well each time but there is always the threat to loose her when i get into the tube or the train without paying for the ticket when i was a child i hid under the sheets out of fear of darkness when i was very young one day i was in the street with my father and brother   while my father was talking to some friends i saw a dog and began to pat it  my father told me sharply to stop doing it because the dog had mange  then my brother told me that i would die and i could not stop crying after this before an exam which i finally did not take before taking an exam when i almost fell down from some rocks because i had been acting foolishly and playing dangerously when i was ten i got shut in the school with a friend  i had to jump out of a window and cross a beam  metres high while i was waiting for them to give me the marks of the most difficult subject this year when i saw a tv

handed copying when i go out alone at night every time i went home with my school report on a trip to santander we wanted to stop at a curve because a friend was sick and the car skidded of the gravel fights that i see in the middle of the street robberies fear of darkness when going home there was an earthquake for several minutes and i was on the eight floor when they tried to rob me when i was attending an authorized demonstrationand the police rushed brutally at the demonstrators without any warning when they threatened me with a knife to take my money when two drug addicts tried to take away my money when i had to walk over three kms through a field which had wild bulls because my car had broken down we were in the country and i walked away from the others one night  suddenly something moved sharply in front of me and i was not able to see what it was one night walking along a park i began to think that some roughnecks would appear suddenly with knives and things like that a film on zombies when i was walking down the street some boys showed me a knife and stole all my money i was walking along a subway when i saw a group of louts  i was rather afraid because i was alone before knowing my marks i was not sure that i wanted to go to that class when i am alone at night after having read horror stories and then i heard unexplainable noises continous fear of a nuclear war i was in sierra nevada climbing a peak over  metres high without any light and with many other problems  i was afraid for my life i was walking in the countryside alone when i came across two dogs who began barking at me  i did not know whether they were tied up or loose but i was afraid of them approaching me one day i went to the cinema to see a film in which i was interested  on arriving there i saw a long queue which i had not expected and went back home without seeing the film when i was operated on the knee and had to go through rehabilitation when my mother was robbed in a shop one night while i was sleeping i woke up suddenly with the sensation that there was someone in my room i had decided to propose to the man i liked to make a trip together  one day during breakfast i told him my idea  i was afraid of his not accepting it and that the idea would end up as a failure once i failed seven subjects at school and i was terrified to give my report card to my father  i left it on the table and went to bed very early in order to avoid him seeing me i stayed alone in the dark at night in the mountain waiting for my uncle  i remember that i took a big stone and it calmed me when my mother had a nervous illness a fall during a climb with almost with no previous experience in a dark street at  oclock in the night and there was complete silence when i was young i saw a horror film  then when i went to sleep the film came back too my mind and the characters frighteneed my imagination it was more that fear  anguish that i felt before my last exam i was walking down a road and suddenly a few dogs appeared at a fence and started barking angrily  they were jumping and it seemed that they would come for me any time i was at the cinema with my sister and her boyfriend  a man sitting beside me started to stroke my leg for a while he left in the middle of the film when i was caught by the police and was kept with a group of delinquents which added to my fear of being shut up  i was afraid of the people near me and the future consequences i had an accident in which i hurt my eye  i was afraid of having injured it badly i was walking with another person when a gang separted us and pushed me in to a house hit me in the stomach and the face then they left  leaving me bleeding when my relatives and i were in a car going slowly on a frozen road when i am walking on the streets and see a gang of thugs on a dark night i felt that there were several people near me and i did not know who they were during a demonstration i climbed up the closed central door of a bus  when the bus stopped i had to go back to the same place afraid that the police would see me    almost always when i go to fetch the results of an exam when a friend of mine told me a horror story we were on the road in a car when a lorry bypassed us  we had to swerve and we almost got run over i thought that i would be scolded for a comment i had made which i should not have made i was in my village when a bull jumped over a fence and started chasing my friends and me  we were very frightened till we climbed up a tree i was walking down a little village at night  there

friend and i went for a walk  it was getting darker and darker and we were not sure of the right way back waiting for my marks in a difficult subject i was attacked by a man at a bus stop at night we were walking in the park at night  it was very dark and very late  we began to hear foot steps all around us and we could not find our way out one night i was alone at home  my fear was caused by some strange noises which put my imagination to work i was watching a procession during the holy week and a penitent approached me i was in a camp and went out for a walk at night on my own  i lost  my way and spent several hours looking for the camp when we got lost in florence and the coach did not turn up until midnight  i had no place to go to and there were strange reports at the police station when i was at home alone i felt a supernatural force dangerous for me and the people close to me we were riding in a friends car  he was driving very fast and suddenly a another car crossed the road in front of us  my friend had to turn the car rapidly i went to visit a friend in hospital  he was going to be operated the next day  i was afraid that they would not let me in and i did not know what his reaction would be on seeing me travelling by coach on a rather narrow and wet road once when i was very young my mother left me alone in the house and came back very late i was spending my summer holidays in a village  my friend and i were coming back from a discotheque at night and we heard a noise from an alley  we were very scared and we got into my friends house  a moment later an unknown car picked up a person from this alley when my brother hit his head and lost consciousness at the sports practice  for some time he could not remember what had happened but he recovered later when i was told that my daughter who is at a boarding school was very ill and that they needed me there the same day when a man who had a knife grabbed me and threatened me with it   during my holidays in monze when i was about six years old i mistook a cat for a leopard      when it entered my room at night i was almost caught in the girls hostel by the security men i would have been expelled from school had i been caught when my fathers home was to be broken into by thieves who had guns when someone tried to bewitch me and my friends at night when i was walking at night i saw fire suspended in

and did not hear any broadcast   what  have i broken the knob  how much does it cost  what if the spare part is not available    i did not know how to tune a radio it was when i dreamt that i had encountered satan he wanted to grab me and take me to his kingdom  he was very repulsive and i have never seen anything like that before i was escorting a relative on a bike we passed by a dark road with bushas on each side  half way down this road suddenly we   saw a white dog appear from one side  before we could do anything it had vanished and moreover it did not seem to have any legs this was at secondary school a prefect framed up some case and took it to the deputy headmaster  i was called by the headmaster and he threatened to suspend me while paddling in the river during a storm  i feared drowning when i saw a ghost the time i was threatened with expulsion from secondary school form four i watched a very terrfying film in   this film really pushed my heart out of my body and i was forced to go out before the second reel ended the possibility of having failed the examination the shooting started and we all lay down to protect ourselves from the flying bullets  this incident occured on our way to feira during the zambia army patrols in the rhodesia war one evening when i had gone fishing with my friends we heard the roar of a lion near by and had to run for our lives i was approaching my exam time and my books got stolen  i was in a panic as i thought that i would not do well enough to be considered for the economics quota  i cried a lot but that did not help and as the exam day came near a strange fear gripped me when i heard a lion roar for the first time when i was going home i saw somathing which looked like a snake   on the road but later i found out that it was only a stick i was walking through a thick forest and there was a big snake at a distance of about four metres we were driving at night and i realized that a car was following us when i took blood from a patient for alcohol estimation and urine for some other examination he told me that something bad would happen to me as he would play magic on me i was sleeping when i heard the neighbours screaming i peeped through the window and saw a thief  trying to enter my neighbours house i had gone for a medical checkup at the uth and failed to make it back on time for the  practical sessions at  hours last academic year when a drunkard barged into a room where my friend and i had run in order to get away from him  we were all alone and all i could see was this hand coming towards me birds had made nests in our thatched roof and they were flying and flapping their wings in the bedroom at night  it was very dark and i could not even see my nose  i did not know that it was the birds till my mother told me so when i came back from work one day the friends of my son told me that he had not come back from school and that he was lost after having taken an exam i feared having failed it when i first came to the unza i did not know the kind of people i would find here and the kind of behaviour they would have towards me when my little sister was sick at home and i thought that she would die when a thunder belt hit the roof top of the building i was in the day i encountered a queer mamba face to face in a chunk of leaves behind our house i was caught doing something i was not supposed to do  i did something with the person who caught me bribe and even though he promised not to report me i am still frightened i was a passenger in a vehicle when suddenly another vehicle came from behind to overtake us  however another one was coming right in front so the other vehicle changed course and blocked our way and so we crashed against the side of the road when i was confronted by a policeman one night around  oclock  i was afraid when they threatened to take me and my girl to the gallows when i was an exploration with my friends and almost got lost in an unfamiliar environment  it was getting dark and we did not know how to get back home when thieves broke into our neighbours house and later we heard gunshots when we forced a friend to chew a poisonous herb in primary school  his tongue was swollen and he told his mother about it  the mother reported it to the headmaster who threatened to expel us i felt very frightened when a robber broke into our house and threatened to shoot my father if he did not part with some money  i was looking at the man with his hand on the trigger i went home late one evening and saw that the security lights were off  i got inside the gate and just then i realized that the dogs may be outside when i saw an accident a woman was run over and she died on the spot when i was told that the form five results were out when i impregnated a certain girl i thought that i would be forced to marry her or go to court two guys were fighting murderously and i feared that one of them would be killed my uncle was taken to the utc for an operation as he had cancer  there had been a lot of deaths of late   out of every  operated  i was scared for my uncles life when i met an elephant in the bush when i was walking around all alone at night when i had to walk along a dark road alone when my neighbours house was broken into and shots could be heard my father had been involved in a car accident two years ago  i was then very scared thinking that he would die as he lay unconscious in hospital for two weeks in   i was going to a school which was near my village and i met a lion on the way which disappeared suddenly in  when my friend was caught by a crocodile  we were swimming in a river on whose banks our primary school was situated  when my friend was caught he was on the banks of the river and some of us were still in the middle of the river  i was very frightened when i learnt that the girl i had impregnated was in hospital and was on the verge of dying as she had refused to accept the responsibility of her pregnancy and had wanted to commit suicide when burglars with guns forced themselves into my house and ordered me to give them money or face death whhen the front tyre of the car burst i was working at a certain place and everyday after work dad would come to pick me up  one day he did not come it started getting very dark and i had no money on me and my home was very very far away last night i dreamt that things that looked like monsters were trying to kiss me the time i drove my uncles car without having asked for his permission  it was the first time that i was driving a car when i was at a boarding school at lusaka the rhodesian soldiers came to bomb a house near our school and we saw the whole scene when my neighbours life was threatened by someone who was trying to break into his house one evening when my sisters brothers and i were watching tv my kid brother took a big mirror and reflected light on the french windows  i thought that these lights that we could see were coming from torches annd that it meant that there were thieves outside when i witnessed a bus accident in which a bus full of passengers  nearly overturned on the lusakakabwe road i got a very nasty electrical shock when i was tampering with some electrical applainces when i thought that i had failed the examination the day i was nearly stabbed to death by ruffians who wanted to take my money  i

last august when my parents dropped me off and moved me into college i didnt know anybody here i was  and berkeley really scared me whenever i think of enrolling in organic chemistry i was walking home from a place on southside and i live on northside and i was followed i headed my most direct route i was river rafting in nev and our boat tipped over and i was sucked under in to some rocks and got stuck and all i could think was that i was going to die and it was so quiet under the water it seemed like no one would care or remember i felt fear when my friend and i broke into an abandoned military base in los angeles this summer i feared because i didnt want to be caught i was scared of water when i was a child when i dreamt that my family was in trouble and was facing many difficulties once i woke up in the middle of the night and felt frightened as everyone else was sleeping and i could not even go to their room once i was caught by thugs aged between  they asked me to surrender all the property i had and i remember feeling very scared when i lost a wallet while travelling since it belonged to the group i was very afraid when going to the exam when our school was raided by the pupils of the boys secondary school who beat us up during the last academic year ie  just before the closure we were surrounded and threatened by the paramilitary forces the first day that i was close to a dead body in my third year at unza school of medicine when mother was very ill i feared that she would die we were driving on a very dusty road at night and the driver tried to overtake a very big truck only to find another big truck parked right in front a friend gave me a lift and we met a roadblock  he tried  to turn back when an officer shouted at us to stop  my friend took a turn suddenly and the officer raised his gun but by the time we were gone i was so sick that my relatives thought that i was bewitched  i felt like dying when i went to my first dental appointment when i entered the dissecting room for the anatomy class and saw several dead bodies lying on the benches when i entered the dissection room for the first time and was exposed to preserved dead human bodies when the time came for me to see dead bodies and to operate on them when i took the first year university exams and made a lot of mistakes in the  exam  i was afraid of failing and thus being unable to go to the school of medicine when i was chased by a big dog near my house when my mother was seriously ill and had to be admitted to the hospital while drinking a soft drink i had the impression of swallowing   a piece of glass so i went to the district hospital and got admitted there when my father was involved in an accident when i was first exposed to the dead bodies for dissecting        purposes at the school of medicine when i was about to be bitten by my friends dog later on it bit me when i was going home for my holiday i almost drowned in the zambezi river i was walking along the passage to my room very near the anatomy laboratory and i heard something and felt that there was some thing behind me  i looked back and there was no one  i started imagining that maybe it was a corpse when my sister was very ill and was admitted to the hospital the first time that i saw a dead person  this was when i started my gross anatomy practicals when i was left alone at home one night by my brother when i was first taken to the dissection room where i found  dead human bodies when i had to talk to some strangers from whom i was expecting a negative answer when i saw the movie poltergist  finding out about people can go mad for social reasons a relative died before the first examn being threatened by another person got ill saw a snake unexpectedly someone

school when my ba results had not come when i got to know that the friend i am closest to got engaged and she was going away  i was overjoyed for her but also felt frightened as i was very emotionally dependent on her  i did not know what i would do without her a few weeks back my daughter had very high fever and i was scared that it might lead to brain damage or convulsions when i decided to separate from my husband that day i was alone at home after coming home from school  i did not know where everyone else had gone i kept waiting for them to come back and nobody came  it was getting very late and i was terrified i had gone to the hospital for my research and got late in reaching home  i feared that when i reached home there would be a quarrel because of my being late when my brother had an epileptic attack and i was scared as to what would happen to him i have done the teachers training course bed  during our training i was asked to handle the ninth standard class in a boys school  i was scared to face the class the first day  i have always been very scared and tense before an exam and before the declaration of the results while trying to board a train i missed the footsteps and fell down on the platform when i was coming back home alone at night when i was  years old i fell severely ill and was bedridden for  months  i felt very scared for my health and my studies i had a very horrible dream one night i dreamt that i had fallen off a very crowded train it so happened that while staying at anaunts place i discovered that i was afraid of sleeping in pitch darkness  the room which my sister and i were sharing had no light and i would refuse to sleep without having the light of the adjoining bathroom switched on when for the first time i rode on a motorcycle with my brother  he was going so fast that i felt that i would fall off without my brother realizing it i was in a garden one evening and i saw a snake coming towards me i was sitting on an electric swing suddenly the machine went out of order while i was still in the upward position  when i had to travel alone unescorted for the first time     it was an overnight journey by train to a distant place i was coming home from a relatives place and it was about  pm  i felt slightly apprehensive when i got off the bus and started walking towards my place  i was confident that nothing would happen to me yet there was this slight feeling of fear i experienced fear when i was not prepared for the final year degree exams when i almost walked on a snake  when i was working in delhi i had gone alone to see the hostel where i would be residing once when i was walking alone at midnight i happened to put my foot on a frog as it felt smooth i thought that it was a snake  and i felt afraid  when my son fell off the cot at the age of  months i became very nervous and thought that it would cause defects in his head   i felt afraid just before receiving the question paper of the part ii exam  fear is an emotion that i experience very often  naturally this is during exams and subsequently while waiting for the results  however there is one occassion when i was paralyzed with fear  this was when i was doing my mai and we had a series of student lectures  i was one of the participants and my lecture happened to be the opening lecture  i had been confident all morning about twenty minutes before the lecture my confidence started failing me  i felt my heart go cold my lips go dry and i was really paralyzed  this incident of fear is still fresh this was when i was being followed home every day from the campus by a stranger  he would follow me to the campus and then sit outside my class  if i was not there he would ask my friends as to where i was  he was a dark ominous looking person and i was terrified of him as i did not know his intentions  i reported him to the security officer who turned him over to the police  i was even more petrified then when i had gone to a school picnic and was left behind in the forest as a child one evening i had read a novel about ghosts and i had thus spent a sleepless night as i kept feeling that there were ghosts dancing around me one day early morning my mother who is healthy fell ill  there was no doctor or compounder near by and for a few hours  am to  pm she did not speak a single sentence nor did she drink water or  milk  there was no movement in her body and i felt really scared  i almost lost my confidence about her survival when i was in my village one of my enemies had written a nonsense letter to a girl and he told the father of this girl that i was the culprit  when i got to know this i was scared as  the girls father was a worse man  i was scared when i realized that i might miss the train which i was supposed to take  i was  kilometres away from home and when  i heard the depart whistle i was still  feet away from the train  i finally made it i was then in the  standard and was going to my native place  the last bus had already left and so i started walking it soon became quite dark  the road was a village road and was deserted i was not even sure if that was the right way  i finally reached home at  pm one of my fellow students had bunked field work and in my attempt to cover up for him i myself was exposed though not directly  we were to meet our field work suprevisor and we were afraid of the consequences a few weeks back i had a very important seminar and i had circulated my papers to all the panel members  a day before the seminar i realized that i had inadvertantly burdened certain       derivations and i had failed to correct it  i feared that this    would reflect very badly on my performance  fortunately none of  the panel members detected it and i felt relieved before the declaration of the ssc results at the age of  i had gone to see a film in a nearby village about  kms  from my home  i started walking as there was no bus  i had to cross hills and as it was dark i could not identify the path  half way through it started raining and as there was no shelter i ran four kms to reach home  i received a letter from my college telling me that i would not be allowed to sit for the exams because of my low attendance in class and the bad experience in t',\n",

face the fact that i had to go for her class  when i got the midterm exam results the results were below average and were near the lowest  i was scared of the final exam i feared that i would not be able to hand in the bookreport on time as i had started working very late  the book was difficult to read and my teacher did not accept my work as it was handed in late looking for the toilet in a

door bell our fear was at its climax i was camping in an old broken hut which had no lights  i had brought along a lamp which was not working very well  the door made strange sounds and i was sure that strange things were happening  the most terrifying bit was that there were many wardrobes in the hut and everytime that i looked in the glass of the wardrobe i felt that there were objects behind me   the whole night was spent in fear and restlessness when i went home and there was nobody i waited till  am and      still nobody  i was suddenly scared and anxious as this had never happened before  in addition my mother was very weak and i feared that she had met with an accident  therefore i was anxious  all night whenever i am alone in a dark room walk alone on the street sleep alone in the room at night or see something which is only partly visible  this emotion was very strong when as an  year   old child i saw something horrible   one day when i was a little boy my friends asked me to play with them outside and to catch some boys  however our parents did not know that we were out and when i got home it was very late and i feared being scolded by my parents i am scared

the next year and that the others would go ahead of me the exam was drawing near and i wanted to prepare for it  but i had a lot of other things to do so i did not have much time to prepare  for the exams  whenever i sat down to study i was scared that i would  not be able to finish it the day the results of the certificate exam came out  i went to school and at first i did not feel frightened

staying in a hotel  the room i was staying in was very silent and had very dim lights  the last night i felt frightened and lay awake  i could hear some sounds around me and dared not open my eyes  i waited for dawn when i was young i got lost on the street and the police found me after a day one year when i went to a camp i was chased by a dog  i tried hard and finally managed to escape from it  my torch suddenly went off and we talked about ghost stories and i thought that there were ghosts i found a problem in homework which would not get solved although i tried my best  once when i was ten i could not remember why my mother was so angry  she fainted suddenly and i was very scared as i did not know what to do  at noon one sunday i received a phone call telling me that my mother had been knocked down by a car at the street crossing and that her husband should go and see her  i could not believe this as my father and my mother had gone out together to buy lunch boxes  however i immediately ran to the scene of the accident one camping night i listened to the ghost stories told by my classmates   after seeing a horror film  omen  i could not sleep at night  even though i closed my eyes  the last scene of the film kept coming back to me i seemed to hear the girls in the film shouting at the devil  the devil did not have any expression on his face and i thought that he would choose me a boy phoned me at night and wanted to talk to me for  minutes outside  i thought that he would reveal what he felt and would question me on our relationship  i treated him as a friend and did not want any misunderstandings  therefore i refused to meet him and told him that i would see him the coming day  i was very unhappy as i feared having hurt him and got him into trouble when i was young i had gone to an old lift and played with the antique lift  the guy discovered me and warned me i was very frightened after listening to ghost stories with my classmates i had to back alone to the hostel at night  i had to walk through a long and quiet road and i was scared of meeting a ghost i did not do well in one of the subjects last term   i was afraid that i would fail  my result

members usually get together at that time someone knocked vigorously on the door it was a week before the higher level results were announced  i had tried and failed many times and this was the last time that i was taking the exam  i knew that if i failed again i woulld have to enter the society  i imagined things during this period  i dreamt that i had entered university and it was a nice experience  when i thought about the future an unexplainable fear rose in me  i feared being a worker and not having a bright prospect i also feared the criticism of my relatives as my brother had gone to university  whenevr i thought of this issue i could not eat or concentrate and my heart beat increased on christmas  i had just finished the exams and was afraid as the results of one of my major subjects had been very unsatisfactory  i thought that i had only a  chance of passing  even if i failed this subject i would not need to repeat  however i liked this subject very much and my results were bad because of my lazyness  if i was forced to change to a minor in this subject i would be very unwilling my parents were out and i was the eldest at home  at midnight a male stranger

after the weekend i think that i should have been able to have accomplished something during that time when one has neglected or been unjust to a good friend  i experience a sense of guilt as my middle son cannot express himself like other children neither verbally nor in writing when i am in an environment or with a person much worse off than me i realize how privileged i am when one lets friends down at my summer job a new caretaker had been employed who was my age  but i preferred going out for lunch with the accounts personnel rather than with him i was the reason behind the breakup of my friends relationship with his girlfriend  she finished with him i hapened to overhear something which i was not meant to hear when i complained about a colleague to the manager and he told her that someone had complained this colleague came to me believing that i liked her i do not help out enough at home when i was young   i pinched from a store and was caught  the store then contacted my parents when i spanked a child in anger and later regretted it terribly when i realized that i had three more examinations to take when i am dishonest to a friend to whom i am very close  i feel guilty because i know that he gives a different version of the truth and i have not corrected these mistakes and he is aware that i know that they are wrong when my father and i worked on the house just after he had recovered from illness i was rather lazy  this meant that he had to work hard and was not very well later i got angry at my mother for something trivial  we were in a bad mood because my father was very ill and i knew that my mother really needed support  i had reacted wrongly due to laziness i failed the term studies completely at university  i also wanted to some extent to protest against my parents expectations i experience feelings of guilt because i do not study enough having been angry and unpleasant towards my parents before an accident my aunt offered me the front seat of the car next to the driver i declined she took that seat and was killed there when the car crashed little contact with my father before he died i made a remark to my sister concerning her attitude to men the way she talked and i compared her to an acquaintance of mine  later the same evening my sister looked sad  i felt guilty about her sadness our association had polish visitors and when they were going back by boat i did not go to see them off i am the chairman of the association i had told my boyfriend that i did not want to go on with our relationship  i knew that i was important to him but i wanted to be free  i saw that this was difficult for him but i remained firm and did not change my mind at my temporary job i have to restrict  others actions and make them obey me and this very often gives me  a feeling of guilt  i wish there could be some other way of acting forced to fill in a questionnaire  i saw a neighbour from the same appartment block as me lying    on the road  he could have been injured or ill  i kept  metres away and did not go to help him   i do not have the time for other peoples problems  my motherinlaw is sometimes depressed and i do not have the time the desire or the strength to help  the time that i had to put my dog to sleep i do not study enough as i do not understand it properly i had lunch with my exboyfriend and did not mention it to my fiancee  i felt guilty despite the fact that i felt nothing for my exboyfriend when i was fined for speeding when i feigned sick leave from work by mistake i took a book from the library which was not supposed to be loaned out i spoke to my mother on the phone  she had skin cancer and was waiting to be operated  i forgot to ask her the date of the operation and just before finishing our conversation she gave me the date in passing  i was unfaithful to my partner once when he was working abroad for a long period when i broke off with my boyfriend after three years  it was quite unexpected for him and there was no particular reason for the break up such as someone else i have chosen to put my son in a private school were the examination marks are low  every time that he gives me his term results i am left with a sense of guilt i arrived an hour late for an important meeting  i had misunderstood the time when i lost something that was valuable to my sister i stole a coconut cake from a reception table and when i put in my mouth i realized that the host was watching me as the only person in my family into academics i ought to have looked after my younger and only sister better with respect to her education and life experiences as i could not be home before midnight i called home at  and asked them to leave the door open so that i could get in  i actually woke up the whole family by calling them so late  my mother could not go back to sleep besides she had a conference   the next day and really needed to sleep when one of my parents insinuates something about the other they are divorced when i demand too much from my friends when my husband talked about the restrictions he will have to accept in his life to make our marriage work  i felt that it was directed at me as it was me who had demanded the changes  we were with a marriage counsellor then not speaking to my sisterinlaw due to lack of interest in a relationship on my side  no answer as i see very little difference between shame and guilt  therefore see answer for shame when i decided to take a week s holiday without consulting the family first i had promised to visit my girlfriend but for different reasons could not make it  i rang up later to tell her that i could not come when i stole money from my mother and she asked me later if i was responsible  i never admitted it when due to hunger and tiredness i became generally irritated with my fiancee and made cutting remarks which really hurt him  later i realized that my unfounded irritation had hurt the person i love most on earth i was  years old when i hid the bicycle keys of a not very good friend  after a few hours i pretended that i had found it many years ago a friend wanted me to with her to southern europe and i preferred to travel alone  i felt guilty because i wanted to go on my own when as a  year old i stole money from my mother when i was forced to decline the invitation to my

all over his clean clothes when i splashed a child by not slowing down while driving through a puddle of water when i was face to face with my deceived friend after sleeping with his wife when i pulled a chair from under someone at kindergarten and he hit his head    when i argue with my sister  it feels sometimes that i have the upper hand and i use it  i often argue better and this makes her terribly angry i have a twomonth old baby  when i came here to the university to attend lectures i had to leave the baby with his father  i felt guilty i stole carrots and got caught  i had to apologize to the owner i ate a runebergs cake though i knew that i would immediately put on a kilo i had to decline an appointment which had been very important for the other person for this reason we even got into trouble i had told a person unpleasant things in a bad manner he was very depressed and caused an accident i had a quarrel with near persons i said many illconsidered things and i regretted it when it was to late meeting a male friend with whose wife i was having an affair i had wasted some time instead of doing something i needed to do to give to a friend also in the time i wasted i had done some things i did not consider morally right leaving a friend of mine alone at a dance  i felt i should have kept her company for the above guilt at not living up to my own moral expectation guilt for not being the type of person my patents wanted guilt for just about bloody everything just realising that i have failed drastically in my own eyes i snapped very abruptly at my mother when she said something silly and stupid in front of other people she looked so defenceless  hurt  told them that im always doing that when a mistake occurred at work which i was not responsible for  this was disclosed later  i was living at home during the summer vacations and towards the end decided to take some of my clothes and other belongings to the appartment in guttenburg

boyfriend when my nephew asked me to tell him a story and i simply did not have the energy or the will  when i saw his disappointment i was terribly guilty and read a story to him after all  i broke

little bit guilty towards my friend i forgot to lock the outside door at my land ladys place doing something wrong at home and then letting my normally more rampant brother take the blame borrowing a car and then having a minor accident breaking a headlight feeling helpless not being able to accomplish what i really wanted to do ive always defended my sister when needed at the expense of my brother this has led to feelings of guilt towards him when i and the boy next door set fire to a house by accident when being illoyal disloyal to people close to me had such an episode with my sister

salvation army to take away a piece of furniture of mine but i forgot to cancel the agreement a friend of mine took it and i thereby caused the salvation army people some unnecessary work i did not go to the exercises without any adequate reason when i think about my family parents brothers sisters guilt is a part of my feelings i got  fim too much when i changed money at the bank  they soon called me at my job and the situation was embarrasing for me while at primary school i did not let a friend ring a bell although he would have liked to do it  afterwards i felt bad i was working as a

away in good faith had been the firstday enveloppes which my father had collected as a young man i promised my friends that i would take care of something but i kept forgetting about it  when they

a pleasant time and did not really take care of the child  i do not care very much about children when i behaved improperly  fought in a public place  afterwards i felt guilty about my conduct i did

ordered some seasonal merchandise but when much of it was left over and had to be thrown away in the autumn i felt partly responsible for the much too large order while travelling in a bus with an invalid ticket i got caught  i had by being silent disapproved my love and made him unhappy  he had not been able to keep his promise  i thus was thinking about my own conduct towards another person the cat of my landlady escaped through the window which i had left open  i speak harshly to my parents though they only mean my own good when i reproached my friend because i was myself lowspirited and disappointed at my job i got disproportionately angry with a child  my reaction was not as it should have been i am going steady with a boy but i had sexual intercourse with another one and i felt guilty about it afterwards for the sheer pleasure of it i quarelled with my boyfriend who was trying  to be especially kind to me when i decided to move away from my parents home my mother told me that it was as if a part of her had been torn out of her i felt guilty when i spent a night at my boyfriends place particularly because i had been harsh and spiteful when i had left home  the reason

her behalf and when i did so my grandmother was delighted and she told me that she had been waiting for some news from us i stopped my car in front of a pedestrian crossing as a child was crossing the

daughter the greatest guilt i felt and i didnt know if it was really justified is that when i was a child i had a brother very close to me he  became ill and asked me to see  him in the hospital i didnt go when his situation became worse in the uit unity of intensive therapy i went and he died the only guilt i considered reasonable was my reproval at the end of the semester at the university the same event described under shame when i provoked a fight with my mother hurting her feelings very much this feeling comes frequently when i go out at night and tell my mother that i shall come back early but then i get home a  or  am it happens sometimes in connection with certain persons with whom i have frequent relationships but nothing special a great friend of mine travelled with the intention to change his life he didnt succeed and returned depressed i had not power to support his frustration and his behavioral change when i acted in a negative way at a certain moment by laziness to concede a moment of the time i thought to be my own being disloyal with persons i loved when i misled a person i said that i would do her a favour and didnt once i promised to do something but i didnt do it a sense of guilt i felt once when i couldnt defend the confidence my teacher had in me and thus discrediting him at a concert i promised to fulfill an errand later i understood it was impracticable the explanation i gave was accompanied by a sense of guilt i felt guilty because of the pain i caused to a very close friend but over the feeling of guilt my conviction of being right dominated i had thrown with the ashtray a still lighted cigarette in the plastic wastepaper basket it had burnt out and my landlords made me a row that i might had set their flat on fire i couldnt fulfill a promise i couldnt fulfill a request of a girlfriend of mine though i categorically promised her and i believed there wouldnt be any hindrance it was partly for objective reasons but also because i couldnt organize myself i was involved in a  attempt on a man i had developed a close warming relationship with although i knew i had done everything i could and that his progress of a normal life was poor i felt guilty as if i could have done more i felt guilty after getting really angry with a friend and having an argument i was being stubborn and proud and selfish because my friend let me down through no fault of her own when i hurt my parents in one way or another it was my mothers birthday my father and i used to buy a present together however now i had bought something together with my girlfriend and i forgot to ask my father i stroke a person undeservedly i felt guilty after i battered to death a classmate of mine i felt guilt because on account of my ambitions i nearly turned my sister out of my parents home some time ago i slapped my son without trying to understand who the real culprit of a damage was after that i felt guilty and bad but it was too late i offended my mother when i shouted and quarrelled and for no reason i had been rude to my mother and when my behaviour had been influenced by other outward factors years ago i ran away from home which disappointed my parents adultery with a friends girlfriend i feel guilty when i should have done something at any rate but i havent done it when i offended my parents without wanting it when i have been overhastingly offending or hurting my roommate got married and invited me to share a flat with them but with a young couple there should not be a third person i am to blame for not following the advise of the others but it is not late still i used to pinch change from my fathers mantlepiece never my mother  she didnt get enough housekeeping and then id feel when we went to church as a family id felt awkward cos i felt im expected to go to communion and i would but i was afraid and guilty cos i committed a mortal sin reported neighbour to police for taking to my daughter with baseball ball  her counsellor rang me and after long talk convinced me the woman was ok i felt guilty for ringing the police then guilty for feeling guilty about it i removed an article of clothing belonging to my employer while in a position of trust i had to leave an important function early because of family commitments someone else had to complete my job when i was young i stole something from a shop and got caught then i was taken to the police station and my parents had to come and get me when i have forgotten to warn somebody for something or when i have forgotten to bring something i have been asked for for example when i have promised something but i havent fulfilled it it happens to me quite often i cant describe a particular case low evaluation of other peoples cares lack of respect for my parents i forgot to convey an important announcement when something unpleasant happens to a friend or relative of yours and you are at the bottom of it quite unconsciously i offended a girlfriend of mine it was really worthy to pass this fact over in silence but i acted so because i believed i was right in fact it often happens to me to feel guilt after i have already done the deed always and this happens often when i do not keep my word when i offend somebody unfairly at a moment of affect i offended a person very close to me he had given me ground for that but it was a trifling in comparison with the way i insulted him a moment later i felt a sense of guilt my son drank four pills of diazepam every two hours instead of amidophen when i had had the possibility to act or to do certain activity better but i had not done it because of reluctance or carelessness when i dont fulfill my obligations in a fit of temper i told things that were unjust and they greatly hurt my mother though she didnt show it my father got a slight heart attack after a telephone call of mine i didnt attend lectures some days ago i had a slight car accident through my fault when i am not able to fulfill any request of my son  cant take him out to ride his byke because i am tired when i dont justify the confidence of people that i respect i offended a person who had done much for me and who had helped me for everything i ignored and offended my parents on the eve of the new year i feel this feeling most often before me not before the others my outside is iron but actually im wasting away i didnt give back in time some money that i had borrowed my friend relied on them we had promised with a friend of mine to take our friends to a restaurant and after having looked for a place for hours without finding one and not being helped by the others we had to give up the idea i got back too late after a sunday going out without having called up home to tell where i was my mother hadnt slept the whole night my mother developed hipertonia and i think i too am to blame bacause with her it is a stress disease i felt guilty when once i made my mother angry i didnt keep a promise i had made to a man and in this way i lost his esteem and confidence in me i caused him a lot of trouble recently when i made a slip and blurted out indecent words in my mothers presence i had an appointment with a colleague of mine to give her my lecture notes i couldnt go and i didnt send them and so the girl missed a day for the preparation of her term exams the assistant professor saw me cheat at the preliminary examination my grandmother has been in a hospital for a week and i still havent had time to see her i felt guilty last year during the winter term exams a colleague of mine asked me to give him my lecture notes i had very good notes and i had passed my exam in advance but i still dont know why i didnt give them to him that colleague failed and he was on the verge of not passing it at the supplementary examinations when i was in the fifth class the rating was done in our markbooks i hadnt been examined yet but i had heard from my classmates about the scolding they had got at home my first mark was in geography  good  i judged i had known for more than that and i put down very good for fear of being scolded naturally my parents guessed all about it they rebuked me for what i had done i had undertaken to help my sister for her class work but some unexpected circumstances prevented me from doing that i felt it when i came home after the examination session and i said i had not passed my last exam the sense of guilt came over me too when i interrupted my studies why  because i felt guilty before my parents  they believed in me though this event did not make them disbelieve me a sense of guilt before my parents when i had to discountinue my studies in the first year because of unpassed ',\n",

knowing if there was a supplementary examination session when i came home with my exam unpassed i felt guilty before my parents when i remembered how much they had done for me i felt guilty when i had taken the car keys and i had an accident but as my parents did not know who was to blame they punished my brother because i had no driving licence and they thought it impossible that had driven the car i felt guilty when i failed to take an exam though i had had enough time to read for it but i hadnt made use of it i feel always guilty before my parents when i come home and have to tell them i

myself and my future i did not attend a social studies observation class for  whole week i am a student trainee teacher anyway the other teachers thought this was okay because the teacher i was supposed to observe was not well liked the teacher was in fact really nice to me  but i wanted to get out of teaching a hard topic he had given me when i had to go to reconciliation before converting to catholicism but then once received  ok this i experienced when going around with more than one girl when i had to lie about my age to be accepted as a member of a group i lied to my mother in the sixth form she said she would ring to find out and i had to tell her i had lied when i masturbated in my room when i betrayed my lover she told me something in confidence i felt at the time i had to

him i had a girlfriend which i used to call regularly then i didnt phone her for a while at a certain moment i felt a little tension which became worse when i took a car which was not mine and suddenly it stopped working i ran over my dog with a bicycle when i was carrying him tied to the handle bar i thought that i could have avoided the above situation the one in fear if i had

i didnt love she however was fallen in love with me i felt responsible for her sorrow i spend the night with my boyfriend while there was also a friend of his we all lay on the floor to sleep when my boyfriend was fallen asleep the other boy and i started petting after  minutes i felt miserable and awoke my boyfriend to tell him that when i was  years old my mother gave me some parts of a chocolate bar and ordered me to bring it to my father working outside on my way i could not resist the temptation and ate it myself very often i take care for my little sister and oversee her duties most of the time everything went fine but sometimes she absolutely didnt want to obey then i hit her we frequently were hit by our father i wanted to finish a relationship after  months unfortunately my friend had a different opinion i could not answer his feelings this made him unhappy and me feel guilty when i realised that i had rejected a boy who was fallen in love with me rather bluntly four times after a quarrel with my mother in which matters were inflated enormously my girlfriend and i agreed to go to the cinema however i completely forgot our appointment i remembered it two hours too late when i went to visit her when i tell someone no in other words when i refuse to do something although i could have helped him after a courtship of three months i made an end to it the boy was very sad about this i once drank too much alcohol and became very ill this was in the presence of my friends when i see that my mother forces my little brother  years to work very hard for school i dont agree that she constantly puts him to work but i dont tell it to her so nothing changes i told someone that i still had a relationship with a boy although it was finished already  months before that person seriously discussed several things relating that issue then i felt very miserable because i had told lies in biarritz the south of france i met some english students who especially for me

              "  'at up a female friend after i heard the defamatory stories that she had been telling  i was later called to explain my behaviour when i was made to feel responsible for the emotional state a friend of mine was in i have cut loose from my father a few years ago i know he is very sad about this when my friend needed my help very much and i at that moment made an end to our relationship someone had to do a lot of efforts to make something work with my help he would have finished much sooner but i wasnt in the mood to help him a friend of mine had a bicycleaccident because i pulled at his handlebar i saved up money for a good purpose as i also have to organise a party i am afraid there will rest only a little money for the good purpose i feel guilty about this when i talked to another student about the notes she got last semester not knowing that she got a lot of bad grades when i had a little accident with my bosscar my mother always evokes feelings of guilt in me for instance when i miss the last bus i know she will be concerned for me and stay awake till i arrive when i didnt bring my girlfriend home one night later she told me that a cardriver solicited her flirting with other girls while i already had a very good relationship when there are problems in my relationship the flirting increases as does the feeling of guilt being catched when stealing i was of the opinion that  pm was too early to be back at home after going out so i stayed away longer knowing that my mother would be worried against the will and without the approval of my parents i went for a few days to my boyfriend in germany that i didnt take the time to make an appointment with someone a good friend of mine who is at the moment in a foreign country i didnt write her for several months and now i feel guilty when i got associated with a boy one year ago i neglected my best friend when the relation with this boy finished she behaved very easygoing towards me i felt guilty then when i dont go to my parents on sunday and phone them to tell them that i have to study the truth is that i listened to sports on the radio when i took the car of someone without saying it to him i felt guilt towards my mother when i went to live on rooms in nijmegen where i study when i became angry at my boyfriend without any reason i know he cannot bear me being angry at him and that he cant study anymore then i knew i had to take an exam very soon but yet i couldnt start studying i also knew it was very imprtant to succeed the exam this time when i have to take exams i am very excited and have not much time for the housekeeping then my friend has to do everything a few weeks ago i thought about an exam i had to take soon i remembered this just before i had to go to sleep i felt guilt because at the beginning of the year i planned to succeed during a holiday in eastgermany i got aquainted with a boy who lived there we started writing but i only wrote once i felt ashamed because i probably was one of his sparse contacts with western europe i was caught sneaking sweets i became very angry with my friend because he didnt do shopping while we agreed on him doing this my being angry was proved to be without reason and i felt guilty about it when having a relationship i made love with another girl when i had broken a piece of glass of the refrigerator by putting a hot pan in it after the death of a girl who i disliked when i cancelled an appointment with an idle story afterwards it appeared that the person had looked forward to it and reserved time for it yesterday my boyfriend and i wanted to play billiards however there were boys playing  times my boyfriend then is fed up and chagrined in such case i think it is my fault i made an appointment to pick up someone however i arrived too late and she had to wait a quarter of an hour when i realized that i avoided two good friends with whom i always shared toys and sorrows i made up idle stories to avoid telling them what happened to me i call my mother at least once a week however last week i completely forgot this morning she called me she thought i felt ill i once torn the inner tube of a bike that was not mine then i saw it was a brand new one i felt very guilty then once after falling in love i imagined that particular girl to be perfect and completely overshadowing my girlfriend afterwards i realized that this image was not objective i felt guilty against both girls a certain friend evokes positive feelings when i am with him but negative feelings when he is not present i feel the need to express those negative feelings however when i speak about him i always think why do i like this he does not deserve this but still i do so i know that a certain person feels very lonely and that she always looks forward to seeing me however often i am too busy to visit her then i feel guilty  i can not remember anything in particular  what i can remember is feelings of having done or said something which then had negative consequences because i had not studied when i failed an exam i thought i could pass easily i went to a pub with a group of friends not very close and i was with one girl most of the time while the other girls in the group wanted to be with me  they stopped talking to the girl i was with after an argument with a friend of mine my younger sister was almost run over by a lorry when my brother ran away from home and i thought it was because of my continously scolding him when i had an argument with my grandfather the day my younger brother was born when i shouted at my mother when she was nervous and depressed when i failed an exam for which i knew that i had not studied hard enough during an argument with my brother i behaved rather intransigently even cruelly wishing to morally hurt the person opposed to me when i was with a girl who seemed to love me while i was with her just to go to bed with her when i triffled with other people i was with a girl one night and then did not call her again although she had asked me to do so i was looking after a child and she fell down because i was not paying her much attention  one side of her face got bruised some of my friends had an argument  i had earlier phoned one of them and that may have influenced him to argue i left a boy with whom i was going around without giving him any explanations when my parents quarelled over something i had done and which was wrong when i inadvertantly made some close friends and relatives feel bad when i hurt a persons feelings when i broke something and a friend of mine was blamed when i saw a program on ethiopia on tv a fews hours earlier i had thrown away some clothes and food i was entrusted with an object and while using it i handled it carelessly and it broke i had an argument with my boyfriend  it was my fault but my pride would not let me admit it when my brother had to spend all evening repairing a gearlever that i had broken when a friend of mine was beaten for what was my fault i could have passed the last exam of the public competition but i failed as i had not studied one night after having decided to finish our relationship i took my girlfriend home  while driving back home i felt that i had not handled the whole thing very well not to have studied enough when exams were near to force someone to do something that suits me i was going around with a girl without loving her  not only did i go around with her but we did many more things  in the end i was not very sincere to her it was about midnight and i wanted to go to the countryside i was in town to watch the stars in the sky  my mother did not like this in spite of it i went out for a while  my mother got angry once i had some homework to do and i did not do it family discord and uneasiness due to something i did not communicate on time as i was not paying attention my little brother fell off the table i had to undergo an operation in summer and so my family had to stay at home during the holidays  i felt guilty above all because of my brothers one day i was alone on duty when a patient choked while eating  i ran to her and tried to make her breath but it was too late i was driving a friends car and i got close to the pavement to ask my way and i struck a parked car when i lost my study grant without having attended any exam in the career i had started and it was too late to cancel my registration once i accidentally injured a boy in the eye and he almost lost it incomprehension and repression towards a childs behaviour commonly not accepted and making the child cry when a close classmate failed a year in an exam i answered the questions rather carelessly and afterwards i thought that the exam would have been better had i answered more carefully when i do or say something inappropriate which hurts people close to me in an exam when i answered the questions with very little assurance due to insufficiet preparation i was alone at home when i broke a figure and then mended it  a few days later my mother noticed it and asked me about it i told her that i had no idea having suffered a not very pretty sight i reacted by uttering some very cruel and sharp words i made another person cry for an unjustified cause i rejected a person whom i had always thought to be a friend  i told him so and he reacted angrily  i felt guilty at not having realized it before and at having hurt him i was in a cafe with another person when suddenly several close friends of my partner appeared  i did not know what to do and my partner felt uncomfortable  when i act thinking that i know everything and i then realize that there were things i had not thought about thus hurting others in a situation with my girlfriend i took a decision  later when i thought about it i realized that it was an erroneous decision a friend of mine felt bad because of something i had done to something that belonged to him when i used an adjective for a person without knowing what it meant   when i got to know the meaning i felt guilty as it was a clear and unfair insult i had an argument with a friend of mine  she would not let me speak and then i began to shout at her  she got angry and left i did not try to prevent her from leaving i had arranged to meet my friends at a certain place and i was with other people  my friends did not arrive and the people who were with me began to get tired  my friends were one hour late when i was very young one day i kicked my grandmother and caused her an injury which took a long time to heal i am not very affectionate and i feel guilty as i do not give as much affection as i receive i had promised to say goodbye to a person who was going on a trip and i did not turn up one night i went out with some friends for dinner and i did not tell my parents that i would come back late  i thought of phoning but in the end i did not  when i arrived home my parents were very worried i had a small argument with a relative and some other people got implicated  it resulted in a proper row at school i did not tell the teacher that it was me who had laughed and she punished the entire class by making them stay behind for one hour at a party several comments were made about the personal situation of one of the people present  she was rather affected and uncomfortable when i noticed the negative changes in a friends behaviour  i was spending a few days at my aunts place  one night i got home very late i had told them i was going to a party but i went to another place  they were very worried due to a misunderstanding on my part two of my best friends quarelled a friend of mine said in a group that she felt lonely and withdrawn from everyone because of mental deficiency when i was young i felt guilty because i thought that i had commited a grave sin a friend of mine had the sleeves of a leather coat stolen from his car  it was me who had left them there for everyone to see classes were over and i wanted to go home  a friend of mine asked me to wait for half an hour to take him back home  i said no   arguing with my younger cousin  she is rather a nuisance but i felt sorry once when i arrived home very late my parents had an argument because of this my mother wanted to stand up for me a friend of mine trusted me to back her in a decision she had made  but when the moment came i did not agree with her opinion when i arrived home late at night  i know that my mother gets worried and this made me feel angry when i did not give back a text book to a friend in time

i kept putting it off  when i finally made it i did not see her for days only to be told one day that she had collapsed and died  i felt quite guilty as she had jokingly said that i might not do what she had requested me to do when i beat up a first year student at my secondary school in my capacity as the deputy head boy  he had woken up late in the  morning for manual work when my boyfriend asked me to go out with him and i refused because i wanted to go out with another guy  i did go out and my boyfriend found out my baby sister was  months old and when i was trying to get her on my back she slipped and fell i was to inform the neighbour on my left that a robber had been spotted the same evening near the house of the neighbour in front  i did not do it and the same day the thieves broke into this neighbours house i was caught stealing a box of matches in the supermarket and had to plead guilty one day my mother went to visit her friends  when she came back she scolded me for not having kept the house in order so i decided not to talk to her when my aunt went out of her way to help me out with my financial problems when i took a small boys share of choclale  he was our guest and so had been given a larger share of the sweets the day i came home drunk after having attended a disco party i was caught doing something bad and i bribed the person who caught me  later i felt very bad maybe i should have paid for my bad behaviour i came across a blind man sitting in one of the corridors and asking for money though i had some money i did not give him anything when my library books were overdue and i did not have the money to pay for them when i passed out a female friend of mine for no apparent reason  i was under the influence of drugs and when i am like that i get mad at anyone however small the provocation when i lied at home   i told them that i was going to a christian meeting and i went to see my boyfriend instead i got into a bad fight in a bar and my friend received a bad cut above his left eye while trying to separate us i took my grandmothers money without telling her and when asked if it was me who had taken the money i denied it the fridge we had at home had a lock  one day when i wanted something i unscrewed the door but unfortunately i was caught in the act when i told a person something that had happened to my friend and this person went and told my friend when i beat up a stupid boy who was fond of cracking jokes on me when i sided with my mother in a quarrel she had with my father before they briefly separated i felt guilty of having suspected my roommate of stealing the money last term we were at secondary school and i was making a lot of noise  the teacher came to ask us as to who was making all the noise  i did not own up so the  whole class was punished i broke a glass of glycerine at the zcbc store in ndola when one of my lovers told me that i was a flirt i did not deliver a message on time when i applied for a false travelling claim allowance and later i thought that i would be found out i felt guilty when i said bad things to my sister i had not intended to do so  she cried a lot and later she fell ill and i felt responsible for her illness when i was late for work and told my boss that it was due to transport problem whereas the truth was that i had woken up late  i thus cheated my boss last year i was asked to look after my niece while her mother was cooking  unfortunately the kid fell off the bed i was confident that she would not fall and had not been paying much attention when i told the driver at my workplace to lie and tell the boss that it was not me who was responsible for the delay  the boss was very annoyed and the driver was punished and a days salary was taken away from him when it was discovered that i had done the assignment at my work place this caused a lot of embarrassment for me when i was caught going out with another girl by my girlfriend one day when i was working i went out for dinner with friends without my parents knowledge and i only came home at  hours this is a kind of confession  my mum found me stealing meat from the pot when i nearly got my fiancee pregnant i failed to keep a promise and this had a serious effet on someones problem when my friend was punished for something that i had done i had stopped talking to a very close friend of mine  a week later he came over to try and make friends with me  again and from the way he talked i felt that he was a very mean preson when i hurt my sisters for no reason at all an item which belonged to a friend of mine was missing  i had taken it earlier and i thought that i had returnrd it so when he asked me for it i stubbornly refused having it  later when i looked for it i found it in my room when i had lied saying that i never take bread from the dinning hall and a friend of mine caught me doing it  he thus proved to me that i did in fact take the bread a girl dropped some stuff from her bag and when i tried to help her i realized that she had used me and i was made to look like a fool when i cheated my father and told him that the school administration wanted  for the purchase of a minibus  two months later the school authorities wrote back to my father for the money  i could not go back and ask him for the money again as he had already given it to me once i told my elder brother that he was irresponsible and that i did not care for what he did because he was teasing me i was drunk one night and i insulted three ladies  the following morning they approached me and asked me the reason behind my bahaviour i apologized for my unruly behaviour when i discovered that the girl i was courting was a relative of mine i bought something and the shopkeeper gave me more change i realized this after i had left the shop and was on the busstop  and i then needed the money when i got fired from a job because i gave a discount to a friend i blew up at someone for being confused and because of his irresponsibility and afterwards i felt guilty and that i had no right when i was  a few of my friends and i would light matches for fun one of my friends confessed to her parents and my parents i guess knew or suspected i was involved but i said i knew nothing about it when i committed the sin of immorality mentioned before a few days back my mother was not feeling too well and still did all the house work  i felt guilty as i had not offered to help  when my pet dogwho was to us a family member died  he had been vomitting for the past three days and we had not found the time to call a vet finally when the vet came it was already too late in the begining of teenage on the matters of sex  speaking about sex  a friend of mine got encouragement and i did not as the supervisor did not like me i had known the girl for a few months when i proposed to her and this put an end to our friendship as from then on we started withdrawing from each other  i liked her very much when i had promised to do some washing for my mother and i did not do it  she did it herself despite her being ill  i felt very guilty when i was scolded by my dad for bad behaviour a very very close friend of mine used to come to my room to      see me and i naver bothered to pay him a visit  one day he asked me the reason behind this and i gave him a shirt when my mother found me in her bedroom stealing sugar in her bedroom  according to our customs there comes a stage when a child stops using the parents bedroom and i was well past that age when my friends and i were caught with our girlfriends outside the school grounds when i was at the secondary school  we were caught by the headmaster a very close friend of mine invited me to spend the holidays with him  he was very kind good and understanding  however it turned out that he had two of his cousins at his place  he however gave me everything i needed  even transport money i was trying to have sex with my best friends girl but she did not agree to it after i reluctantly refused to dine with a certain man on the same table the first time that i played with myself despite being a christian  i had read in the bible that it was wrong to make love to someone one is not married to when i realized that not all my friends like the comments that i pass in their presence when my friend ended up pregnant by a gentleman whom i considered to be good and faithful but he ended up neglecting her and not bothering about her when i told my uncle a false story  that people had stolen the books from my room and i demanded money from him  when he found out the truth i was in trouble when i overate at lunch when i lied to the physiology teacher i was to take a test and i had not made the necessary preparations until it was too late  there were two days to go and i still had not done much when i got very drunk and really misbehaved at christmas when i cheated my trusting girlfriend by telling her that i was a qualified

uneasy once when i was in the cell group religious activity i found that almost everyone in the group read the bible daily and i felt guilty in my heart that evening when i opened the songbook while i was singing the song those were the days that guilt feeling became stronger  the lyrics described well  i was really wrong  the wish that i had made was really bad if she were with me i would really be happy and we would play happily together like the days in secondary school and she would not be disappointed and gloomy because of me my friend came to the concert for my sake as it was me who had organized it and the concert was unsuccessful i refused to lend my homework to a friend one evening i went fishing with some friends but we could not fish as a fisherman had already put his net there  we pulled out the net to find only crabs in it so we threw the net away  the net was large and may have cost   the fisherman used the net to earn a living and we had had thrown it my younger sister wanted to take classes to learn a musical instrument  one saturday morning my mother asked me to go with        her for the registration  i did not want to go  so i said that there might be many bad people at the club  as a resullt my sister was scolded by my mother i made my boyfriend so unhappy and depressed that i feel guilty when i was fighting with my elder brother i unintentionally hurt   him in the eye with a wooden bar  i felt guilty and feared that he would be blind fortunately he recovered after  days i prayed unfaithfully one day while we were strolling along the road one of my friends suggested that we go and watch a blue film  i was curious so i went along but i felt quite guilty later i was cold to my sister without meaning it just because i was upset and frustated i had promised myself that i would do one good deed every day  one night i saw a beggar whose muscles had been atrophyed  i walked passed him thinking that he was feigning  later i realized that he had not been pretending and i had a feeling of guilt as i had not kept my promise i felt guilty at not having practised the piano  i waste my teachers time and guidance i entered the hostel this year  my mother was ill and could not move and needed people to look after her  every week i left home to go back to school i felt guilty i took french leave to do my homework saw a blue film in a cinema while quarreling with my brother i broke the glass door of the cupboard and a china doll  we were scolded by my father for breaking the door but we did not tell him about the door failed to keep an appointment after masturbation i said something which was against my conscience i joked with an unfamiliar friend in an obstinate tone  i was afraid of his misunderstanding me and being hurt and angry at me  i felt sorry over my conduct and thought that i had to find an opportunity to apologize i had fixed a meeting with my classmates and i missed it as i was tired  besides everyone at the meeting was a stranger to me and i did not want to make friends with them  whatever the reasons  i  felt guilty while playing basketball i broke a team members spectacles  his face was injured by the  pieces of glass  it was not serious but i felt guilty and blamed myself for being too careless and vigorous in my game after an exam i was in a very bad mood as i had done it very       badly  at home my mother took so long to ask me how things had  gone that i lost my temper  i overreacted and made my mother cry she still prepared lunch for me and did not scold me   suddenly i thought that it was my fault and i started crying    when i break someones things out of carelessness or do something  to make others feel unhappy  or hurt the selfesteem  selfconfidence  of others especially if they happen to be friends or family members i was so excited once that i told my classmate that she was old this hurt her and i felt guilty we always made a lot of noise during a certain lecture  this may have been because we did not respect the lecturer finaly the lecturer could not tolerate it and he scolded us angrily and pointed out our misbehaviour many years back i quarrelled with my younger brother for a small reason  i used a pole to beat him and nearly broke his arm  he recovered after a treatment which lasted several months  after this our relationship was worse and he would not listen to me our class had organized a picnic in november  i was the class representative so i became the organizor  however the picnic was postponed by one week and i had something else to do then initially i did not ponder on what to do and decided to go for the picnic  when i had the time to think about it i thought that my decision was wrong  my classmates thought that i would go as i had signed my name but i did not go  i told another class representative that i was not going but he did not know the reason behind my not going  after the picnic my classmates asked me why i had not gone to the picnic and everytime someone mentioned it i was apologetic  i should have decided right in the begining that i would not go and then they would not see me as irresponsible ie promising to go and changing my mind afterwards one nightwhen i was in primary  or  i felt thirsty so i fetched the thermos to pour a cup of water for myself  then i saw my brother lowering his head and i jokingly poured the       water on his head once i bought my sister a pair of sports shoes as she was going to join an athletic meet  however the shoes were a little big and had a few flaws  she muttered all the way and blamed me for having wasted her money anf i felt guilty when i was in  i was always punished as i would forget to do my homework  the first time that i was punished and not allowed to leave school i slipped out of school i promised to join a meeting but did not turn up as i did not want to do the work when my behaviour was immoral  thinking about sex i borrowed my classmates notebook one week before the examination and i promised to give it back to her in two days time  i was very busy at that time and forgot many things as i was not very often at home she could not contact me  when i started my revision i realized that her notebook had been on my desk for five days  i contacted her immediately and gave it back to her  though she did not say anything i felt very guilty once my friend and i went to the tai  to cycle  my mother had told me not to go  unfortunately i broke my pectoral girdle and had to go to hospital  when my mother  came to see me i felt guilty as i had not listened to her and i had to soon sit for a public examination i went to a friends baptism as she became a christian after me and i realized that she was more enthusiastic about her spiritual life than i was  when i was with my brothers and sisters of christ i had a guilty feeling which could not be dismissed easily  when pepole asked me as to when i would be baptised my guilt feeling deepened once i quarrelled with my sister and after this i deliberately messed up her belongings i wanted to get rid of a bad habit and it seemed that i had succeeded  however a year later i got the bad habit again  i felt  useless as i always found excuses to explain my behaviour  as a result i felt guilty one night during dinner my nephew was naughty so i quarrelled with my  parents   i regreted this as my nephew was only two years old and i  had to tolerate him   the quarrel made my father think that his children  may not take care of him in the future it was a slip of the tongue and  this made me realize that my father keeps his thoughts to himself  i was  still very angry so i dropped my bowl and chopsticks and went to the kitchen  to drink tea and then ran to the other side of the house at secondary school one of my classmates lost her locker key  during a class i saw two other classmates holding a key and talking secretly  i do not know why i suspected them also another classmate supported me  he remembers that these people had only one key in the keyring this had seemed strange to him  besides another classmate said that he had seen them selling books at a bookshop and they should not have had such books  i told the teacher and the person was caught  he had sold the books and was forced to quit school  i found that i had not helped him as he stole later on also  i felt guilty i escaped from communicating with god for a long time  i did not read the scriptures and i did not pray  i felt that i was getting further and further away from god  i felt guilty as this was because of my laziness once while playing tennis with my classmate i lost a few tennis balls  i found one near the tennis court and took it to be mine despite thinking that it might belong to the student in the next court  i felt guilty  later someone came to me to claim the ball and i gave it back to him peeping there were old people in a crowded bus and i did not have the courage to give them my seat  i closed my eyes to sleep and then opened my book to read  in my heart i wanted to give them the seat in the past i used to think that my mother was a very nagging person  when i started living at the hostel we had little time to meet each other  whenever i went home she would take care of me  i gradually realized that what she had done was for my own good  so very time i saw her i felt guilty i lied to one of my best friends i had shouted at my younger brother and he was always afraid when i called out loudly'],\n",

universiity when i told my girlfriend a joke openly and frankly when i finished the work that i had planned to do  my homework several good friends made me a surprise visit and this made me happy  they are my closest friends and we had not seen each other for a long time i remember my religious experience  during  a gospel camp a few friends of mine decided to believe in god  the joy that i felt at that time was more than words can express  i blessed them and praised god in my heart i learnt from the newspaper that i had been accepted at the chinese university of hk  it was  oclock in the morning  later i told my family and relatives about it and had tea with them very joyfully after a busy day i went back to my hostel  i closed the door and had a drink then i read my favourite book on the bed  suddenly i felt peace and joy i was appreciated by others especially my family members and my friends when i received the letter informing that i had been accepted to be a chinese university student i was excited as i had longed for it  during a certain period i felt successful and extremely satisfied   when i found that any tasks or decisions that i had made were better  than expected i felt happy when i received the letter telling me that i had been admitted to the university one saturday afternoon i deliberately dressed up nicely i had been in a bad mood of late  i hoped to go for a walk in the soft sunlight to try and uplift my spirits  when i was having lunch in the canteen two of my male classmates asked me as to why i was dressed so nicely they had seldom joked with me before  one of them said that he had a lounge suit and we would look very nice if we wore them together it was the first time i met him my boyfriend mrw  it was during the first term summer vacations  we met each other while handing in our homework  he invited me have a trip with him and we were together till  pm i had gone camping with my old classmates and there was a storm  we were in a flurry but at that time i felt the love and concern of my friends when the result of the certificate exam was announced  i was surprised and happy as the result was better than i had expected i was admited to the chinese university of hong kong  the day the results were announced i looked in the newspaper and saw my candidature number  during my summer vacations i planned a carnival for the community youth center with a few other volunteers  i was the head of the organizors and we spent over a month planning it  during this period we got to know and understood each other  we discovered each others potential and we planned many interesting things for the carnival  the day of the carnival everything was bright the programmes went well and the attendants enjoyed it  i felt extremely excited about it when high level results were declared i found my candidature number  i was very happy as i had not expected it  as i had been  injured before the examination and i had performed poorly after attending a song contest proposed by a band called chyne we  of us waited for the members of the band to greet us in front of the stage  we went out after a few minutes as it was time to close the hall  we had been waiting at the entrance hall for ten minutes when three of the band members came out  they were very excited to see us one of them was so excited that he had tears in his eyes  we felt very warm and close to each other  they took us back into the hall and we talked freely  we were together for about an hour and during this time we felt that they were very sincere when i received the result slip of the higher level examination an university entrance exam and saw that i had a very good possibility of being accepted into the university i felt very excited i had a dream  i had a very close friend who had several stone houses in the new territories villages but they did not have much furniture  he took me to see his fields i had never seen them before and there were several inches of clear water on which the sunshine was reflected  i wanted to sit among the short green plants in the fields but was afraid of treading the plants to death  my friend said they will not die and i sat down happily and my trousers did not get wet during the exam period i studied in the library alone  a close   friend of mine who is also a classmate told me that my application for a japanese intercultural exchange programme had been accepted  i was not very sure as i did not know that the list had been declared  i ran to the board and saw that i was really included in the list  i was so excited that i smiled all day long  when i met my classmates and friends i told them the good news  i was so happy that i could not concentrate on my studies  that afternoon i rushed home to look at the result slip of the higher level as fast as possible  i opened the envelope very carefully and found that my results were much better than i had expected and thus i could enter the chinese university  my diligence had paid and i was very happy one night my boyfriend expressed his love for me in the canteen in the presence of my friends by giving me a present when two female classmates and i were having lunch we chatted and  cracked jokes i was very happy  however i felt that i may have  said something inappropriate which might cause them to have a bad  impression of me when i received a letter from the university telling me that my application had been accepted i had a picnic with old classmates we chatted and played games it was the first time that i gave a birthday present to my friend   she wrote me a letter as she is my girlfriend  the content of the letter was so sweet that it made me feel very happy in  the long awaited big envelope a document for cuhk admission arrived  it was in the afternoon and i had not been doing anything  when the postman with his big bag knocked on the door i knew what it was about  i hurriedly opened the envelope and my mood at that time is hard to describe  it lasted several hours and only calmed down later i received a letter from a distant friend admir admirable admirably admiration admire ador adorably

rather close to me and i ',\n",
              "  'thought about the sad incident that had happened to them in the near past i knew that they were thinking about it too when i made the call when one of my cat died of a disease the death of my grandmother i had had a farewell party at the place where i had been working for a year  that night i could not fall off to sleep  i was sad thinking that i would not see my nice fellow

arms one wakes alone and knows that the lonely arms of the night are not the same that one meets in the morning a close friend of mine had not contacted me for a long time i felt sad after having had an argument with my boyfriend  i felt that he did not understand me and that there was no point in carrying on with the relationship i got to know about the death of a close friend estrangement from my best woman friend  we have been going different ways for quite some time now but the break was total when she got married as her husband is unreasonably jealous of me i felt sad at having to leave

with my parents we had to finish the life of our  yearold dog  i tried to talk to my parents over the phone as i wanted to go home for the weekend and i knew that i would not be able to bear it  i tried to reduce the gulf and the conflict between us by talking in order to unite our worlds  result  hysterical mess blinding and blaming my child unexpectedly started acting in a restless and disturbing way at school  in addition his performance at school weakened the breaking up of a long lasting relationship when my friend did not pass the high school graduation examinations a relationship in which i had put my trust broke up  i was sad when i realized how easy it is to forget something that one had once regarded as great and significant when our dog died the last time i felt sad and disappointed was when i did not do as well as i had hoped in one of the final exams  as compared with the earlier exams the questions i think were unjust being away from a very close friend i was away from finland for a year as an exchange student i could not meet my love after having waited for a month due to illness after my boyfriend and i had separated when my grandfather died i saw my grandmother crying against my aunts shoulder i had never seen my grandmother cry before when i had to move away from home to study and i knew that i would not be coming back home for a long time the breaking up of a relationship  we decided that the relationship could not carry on so it was no surprise to me and anyhow i had known it would happen sooner or later my best friend had a relatively severe illness  i was sad because she was suffering when my grandmother died of cancer when my grandfather died my guineapig had been ill for a couple of days  one evening when i came home i enquired as to how it was doing  my mothers expression told me that it had died  my knees refused to support me and i began to weep convulsively when my sister left to go home in sweden after the christmas holidays the death of a close relative the fact that my mother is getting married again my mother and father divorced about  years ago means that she will probably move to turku and our home which is a one family house will be sold i myself have not been living at home for the past six years i was on a class excursion by boat to stockholm  at night my class mates prepared to clebrate their motive in life which was life is merriment  i felt depressed about the way they sought happiness i was sad when i saw that a beautiful girl was not attainable i worked for seven months in a factory and made friends with a fellow worker  later i visited my former fellow workers and was told that while in the army my friend had shot himself i lead a rather secure life  the only thing i can remember is a song from the nineteenth century which is against alcohol  both the melody and the word although naive effected my emotions when i heard about the death of frantois truffaut the french motion  picture director on the radio  i had planned to go and see his last film when my car froze and i could not start it when my grandmother died of cancer christmas eve there was a tension between my parents they did not even try to restore a harmonic atmosphere mother stayed in her room almost the whole day i felt alone and was very sad when i was six years old my favourite cat died i heard

melbourne to brisbane all my old school friends gave me a party and i had to say goodbye to them all i was terribly upset when my kitten got hit by a car he didnt die but for several weeks we thought he might have to be put down at end of school  function to celebrate  leaving friends who id known for up to  years a friend of mine is having psychiatric problems because of his mothers death ages ago he is really quiet and because it relates back to his childhood i feel sadness for him he doesnt lead a normal life and it just seems unfair my father died last year after an  severe illness passing away of my father when i left all my friends at school break up knowing we would probably all go our separate ways and none see one another for a long time i broke up with my boyfriend of seven months but it was a very indepth relationship and so after feelings of grief and loss were over i felt an immense sadness thinking about friends overseas at our senior dinner  separated from school friends nothing will ever be the same again when my father died when my father passed away of cancer i was extremely saddened he was not very old which made matters worse the actual death was horrendous but the moving funeral saddened me more so when one of my closest friends died unexpectantly when felt lonely about writing my family the first time i left home close relative is dying of cancer  found out last week after the fact that made me ashamed i felt sadness to fight with a sister and to know that she doesnt care i felt it when i was at home and saw a discussion without sense between my parents the death of my grandfather when my team lost a championship i got separated from the man i loved when i got separated from the man i loved so much when my friend girl went abroad for two years i was alone at home on new years eve unrealisation of the desired profession aviator death of grandfather unexpected i left my home in melbourne to come to qland to study and before i hopped in the car i hugged my mother and shook hands with my father sensing immediately my fathers sadness i also had a flood of the same emotion as a child  having a dog  it getting a disease and dying having to decide on a termination of a pregnancy after discussing it with friends family and the man involved upon moving away from home for the first time to a different city i felt no longer under the wing of my parents even though they would always be there to help me i felt a sense of loss i was now all alone in the world responsible for my own actions a very close friend from victoria visited me over the holidays having enjoyed his company immensely over  short days i was overwhelmed by sadness when he left to return to victoria when my son was diagnosed as having cerebral palsy at age  he would have to endure so much labelling stigma and discrimination even though his case was relatively mild my mother left my father for his best friend and he moved to papua new guinea despite the fact that i am closer to my father than to anyone else in my family i had to move in with my mother and say goodbye to my father not knowing when i would see him again leaving home to move closer to university as an oldest child this experience was traumatic for both my parents and myself when my family heard that my mothers cousin who lives in england wrote us to tell that he had cancer of the lymph glands i dont know why suddenly i thought that what i was feeling for my boyfriend was not really love after almost three years being together this matter of fact shaked me and i felt a great sorrow that i can call sadness when my grandmother died some colleagues decided to go out on a saturday not inviting me to decide either the place nor the time i felt sad when i was despised by another person i couldnt sleep and began to remind of my childhood we are many sisters and at that time we were spanked a lot and i dont know why i started to remind of the spanks they and i had had their shouts when this happened when i applied for the college entrance examination to fuvest and i wasnt approved in the second fase it happened when i lost two very intimate friends in a car accident when i couldnt go for a trip with my friends in a holiday during an informal talk with a friend when we talk about the life of another person a common friend that is in a situation of not being able to assume certain problems that he decided to solve that is she herself suggested the problems and decided to solve them but didnt get it until the moment when i became conscious that men dont wnat anything they dont have a goal they have sex but this isnt important when i knew almost the same day about two great friends of mine that had serious existential crisis and mainly when i notice that im in the same situation that they are but i didnt realize it when my grandmother my second mother died to buy a car and didnt like the business and the car a friend of mine lent me his apartment for holidays and besides this he was a fine person months later i knew that he died tragically in a moto accident he was very young and i felt sad and couldnt believe it until today when i knew that a person that i liked very much didnt react the way i would like to even that i knew about his feelings for me when i was betrayed by a friend and decided to stay apart form her i remember the day my father died i was  years old and my sadness was so great that until today i remember everything about that day from the clothes i was wearing to the reactions of people the despair of my mother and brother it marked me a lot and was the greatest sadness i felt my fiancts family was adopting a  years old boy i felt myself close to him as i never felt before after some time his mother demanded the care of the kid and we were obliged to send him back when i deeply felt that i could lose the person i love best because of my foolishness when i try to get closer at a person and she misinterpreted me the second time i went to the entrance exam to vsp and didnt get approved last year when i took the college entrance examinations i failed the fuvest it was for me the most frustrating situation because i had studied all year long and only thought about this when i was  years old my father travelled very much for his work he passed three months away from home in the  my boyfriend asked me to forget him as it would be ea',\n",
              "  'sy a close friend travelled to another country when i knew that he would only come back after many years i felt very sad when on christmas day my grandmother died i received the news when i was coming back from a party on the  at  am a dear friend was removed from the division whre i work when i knew about my sisters in law finacial situation and what she was facing i felt very sad when i saw the first list from the names of the people who entered at the university and my name wasnt there when i didnt succeed to enter at the university i felt that the college entrance course sistem prejudiced me that my integrity and effort werent corresponded when my boyfriend was changing his behavior there was something wrong i felt sad because its desagreable when a relationship is ending when i felt alone and without love when i noticed that i do many things to the pregiudice of myself when my dog died my brother wanted me to buy a flute with him but i didnt accept afterwards i regretted it because he became sad the day that the results of the college entrance examinations for the s paulo university were published and i didnt find my name on the list entering this university was my greatest wish and  the fact of not having succeded caused a great frustration and not only sadness i felt sadness when i notice that im not important for a determinate person we do many things for a friend and we see soon after that he doesnt do anything for us nor thinks of us i am always sad when my boyfriend goes away he lives and studies in an other city we have gone steady for  and  years and everything is going very well but sometime this situation makes me feel bad and very lonely one night a very dear person said i hate you of course it was an impulse and this person didnt feel that about me the person expressed regret and everything was settled but i cant forget when my grandmother died one day i heard from a friend that the boy i loved had gone out with her and not with me one of the greatest sadness was when my grandfather died because i loved him very much for not having succeded in getting the job as a translator that i wanted after a disagreement between my parents when i was alone with my father and my sister the aggression continued when my father tried to put me and my sister against my mother revealing facts that had happened in the past like a talk between my father and his mother in law where she told him that my mother was not quite save i was watching television it was about midnight when a very dear friend called saying that his father had died in an accident when i thought for an instant that a very good relationship with a person had finished in a social situation i became interested in a woman we talked we laughed we enjoyed each other she desappeared for a few minutes and a little after appeared with an other man when i felt lack of aid from close friends i didnt get the job i wanted when i got separated from the woman i loved i feel sadness from the fact that i was not born with a better appearance the sudden death of one of my parents getting separated from my family for a week caused me a sense of sadness i feel sadness when i only imagine that i could lose a close person some time ago i lost a man whom ai greatly respected when i left my boyfriend i found another girl at his home but he did nothing to relieve the situation i got separated form my closest friend he went to work abroad i saw a friend of mine who had suffered a very heavy contusion after an accident when i couldnt find my dog which was missing a close friend decided to stop with his study and to go back home i felt sadness when i had to get separated from the woman i loved who had to leave for her motherland my living and working conditions at home were unbearable we used to live in a three room flat together with two more families the discords caused a change  one of the families moved out the other family stayed with us but i drifted away from my fianct in fact we were two families in the flat then i found myself alone in the struggle for this life because my fianct did not stay next to me my grief and sorrow took on large proportions i wanted to commit suicide but instead i threw myself against the cause of the irritation a sudden doubt made me run for a long time in a rainy autumn night when i reached the intended place i saw my beloved in another mans arms a sudden blow grief i cannot qualify it it is painful for me to remember about it when i quarrelled with my boyfriend when i had stayed abroad for a long time and i had remembered about my friends and relatives i felt sad and i wanted to see them as soon as possible for the loss of a close friend or relative but you feel grief when you are away from home too i couldnt be with a girl on whom i was very keen the loss of a very good friend i feel sad when i see things done against men and nothing could stop it  at least i think so when my grandfather died my brother is a soldier he promised to come home in a furlough but in the last moment he phoned and said that he could not come we are several friends but our characters are very different and we inevitably split in the two extremes it is sad that i myself dont know what to do i try not to hurt either of the parties because there are conflicts to which one i should belong sometimes i experience sadness for the sports high school and for my unrealized dreams in the sport anyway there i spent six years of my life guy i cared for went back to canada to live my brother in law was dying of cancer to see him wasting away was very sad a boy i look after for the probation service deliberately offended to provoke a reaction from the police i was driving near my girlfriends house and i decided to keep going because it was late and i would be back in the next few days anyway the next day she was killed in a road accident when for example i left for the first time my parents and i went to live in sofia recently i happened to remain alone for a long time feeling unable to preserve ones ideas and ambitions as innocent as they are when you are young getting separated from my girlfriend after the loss of a close relative when one is alone and knows that all the others are celebrating sometimes when im alone i am seized by this feeling but it always helps me to come round and at the same time to judge if it is worth very often this feeling is caused to me by people  friends who i love and respect summer heavy rain storm  i was standing with my face stick to the window the childhood something was going away forever this summer i was leaving my home i was going to study in another town for the first time i was leaving my parents friends i had to manage myself a long and loved period of my life was over  i was crying when the man i loved decided to leave me forever the thought that ill never sit at the school desk again caused a deep grief at the end of my eleventh form my son lives with my parents in the country and i feel this feeling always when leaving for sofia but the last time it was quite strong when i left a man in whom i really believed at an unjust insult or injure when i am alone and listen to a song which i like very much and which i had listened before together with friends i felt sadness when i remembered my former boyfriend with whom i got separated an year ago and when comparing him with my present one with whom things are not much of a success my grandmother died some months ago my wife gave birth to twin sisters she had no idea of looking after babies and she felt quite oppressed the fact that i couldnt help her caused grief to me from the fact that my husband and i are not in good terms at an irrevocable loss with respect to human relations at a prolonged separation with my family my son lives in the country i feel sadness when i see mothers having walks with their children alone i am coming back home in the night after the serial explanation i lost a close friend when i feel i must be with somebody to talk with somebody  but i am alone it happened that i was alone  with no contacts with friends when my dog was stolen when i failed at the first entrance exam sadness  this is an emotion which i have felt very often recently i cant remember a concrete example i will describe my general impression from severl situations which evoked this feeling in me for the girl who halped me go on living and made me happy  when i dont see her even for two or three days sadness no i felt something much stronger when my father died the loss of a person i loved very much i felt sad when my first boyfriend and i left each other it was neither his fault nor mine years ago i fell in love for the first time as natural for every schoolgirl i was daydreaming later after  years we left each other no one was to blame but i felt deep sadness even now i remember about it quite often my boyfriend is a soldier he was on a leave i felt sad when we had to get separated again when my first boyfriend left me i tried not to let him understand i felt miserable this feeling was quite deep when my friend girl died in a car accident the loss of a close relative who was ill with cancer when you are far away from relatives and friends i feel sad for my early years for the freedom and the carefree years of childhood when i part with my friends i feel always sad for some time i cant remember a concrete example now for example i have just parted with a friend of mine and i am feeling sad when i quarrelled with a very close friend of mine i met a girl some time ago and i cared very much about her but it happened so that we left each other i felt some sort of sadness i think i can call it so when my mother and father were on an excursion in chechoslovakia and i was at a student camp and i heard over the radio about the events that were taking place there i felt sad when a friend of mine died and i felt that something had irrevocably gone away from me always when i get separated from my friends and relatives from my home town after my fathers death when my first girlfriend an i left each other when i got separated from my first love the funeral of a friend who was killed in a car accident she was of my own age there were many of my own friends present as well as her family etc when i saw my niece  yrs crying in the hallway for her mother who had passed away about a month ago felt sad about some street kids in queii square aotea square because they had been sniffing glue and some were very young i went into the role of a performing clown when my father a  generation colonial from eng attacked me verbally about my chosen partner a man whom he discarded because his colour skin was not white his ultimate disgust saddned me my dog of  and  years  lord grey died in his sleep  his death caused me more and deeper sadness than i thought when my grandmother died very suddenly without warning i had been living in an overseas city and made the decision to leave the city and come home about  months before i met a whole new set of friends leaving them at the airport was sad and traumatic as they had helped me',\n",

one  my heart seemed to cease beating  i was silent for some time and then i whispered goodbye and left without turning back i had been separated from my girlfriend for about a year  on her birthday i put a present in her mailbox  i had spent two days choosing a suitable present for her  i waited for a few days and there was no reply from her at last i received a thankyou card in my mailbox  on the card there was only my name the words thankyou  and her signature  i was very sad then my mother suffers from a mental illness  one night she was not feeling well and was sent to the hospital  i was scared that she would die and all night i was very sad and did not dare to close my eyes my sister was impolite to my father when the family was having lunch together at a restaurant  she thought that our parents had been prejudiced against her this was an extreme thought when i found that my coldness had hurt somebodys sincerity i saw a lot of starving people in a tv news report when my mother went through an operation it was not very serious but i was sad and could not sleep before the operation when i learnt that my close friend was going to immigrate when my studies are too demanding and i cannot cope with it when the thing that made my friends and relatives sad happened to them one of my good friends had to migrate to america  our friendship had developed quite well and it was a pity as our friendship would fade when i said goodbye to my girlfriend  i had spent two years on developing this relationship and it was unsuccessful i felt very sad i heard of the death of a closefriend of mine  i had gone camping        with him shortly before his death and the whole thing seemed very  sudden to me  i had a schoolmate who went to the hospital as her brain was bleeding  she fell unconscious for three days and when i went to see her i saw the miserable state the family was in  moreover i could not do nothing for her  i was very sad  finally she died there was a conflict of interest between me and a close friend of mine  he only thought about his own interest and not about our friendship  this behaviour hurt his friends  another incident is when a friend isolated himself without giving any reasons about two years ago my girlfriend suggested that we separate  this really gave me a shock as i had never thought that she would say such things  the reason she gave me was that we were not suited for each other when i learnt that i had failed an exam  this not only influenced my emotions but also other important tasks it also made my record imperfect a few years ago my mother suffered from canccer and died within two years  we had not finished our studies then and could not bear our responsibilities as her children  my mother had tried her best to take care of us but she lived in pain these two years  neither the doctor nor we could do anything for her as cancer is incurable  i was very eager to replace her in suffernig  even die instead of her after a meeting ended we started talking about when we would have the next discussion  i had many tests the coming week and could not have a meeting in between i thought that they would understand this as they had always done  they did not understand my problem and thought that i should not have so many other activities  their reaction made me burst into tears when i was a child i was playing on the upper deck of the bed with my brother  my parents slept on the lower deck  my father felt disgusted and beat me up  i felt very sad as my father had never beaten me or scolded me before i am a christian but i cannot find any meaning in life  it seems that i am deceiving myself but i cannot find the way out my academic result was poor and i had to repeat the second year  i felt sad about the coming several years i received the midterm exam paper of one of my major subjects and i found that i had failed it when i found that my ability to do ordinary work was worse than my fellow mates   i quarrelled with my younger sister because i had said something against her boyfriend  consequently she looked through me when she saw me as she thought that i was trying to separate them  she had misunderstood me when i was in lower six class during the summer i joined a research group of the chinese university student union  i knew a lot of cv students there  a year later one of them was travelling in mainland china and he got tb  he died a few weeks after coming back to hk  we all got together for the funeral and when i looked at the body for the last time i felt extremely sad when i was ill and had to stay at the hospital for a period of time   i suddenly found that those whom i considerered to be my good friends did not care for me  although i could still be with them i felt unimportant  i deeply thought about the reason behind this so as to see who was responsible for this  finally i made up my mind and decided not to expect too much from them  i was sad when i decided that they were no longer my good friends a friend told me that he had suffered in love and in academics  i shared his sadness my got my mathematics tests marks and could not believe that it was true  in the past i would have at least  marks  was i getting weaker at studies   this made me feel that i should not expect too much from going to the university my examination results were not satisfactory even though i had tried my best  then i started wondering about my abilities for the major subject  however i did not know how to choose my major subject if i were to change it last night i did not do very well in one of the subjects  before the result was announced i feared that i would fail  finally i got a d and as the results of the other subjects were not all      good i felt a little sad one night my father suddenly suffered from a heart attack which lead to breathing difficulties during the physics experiment session i did not understand the content of the experiment and did not know how to do it when i was in primary  my father died  i was very young then and did not know what had happened  the weeping of my relatives and my tears made me sad this issue worried me rather than saddening me  in mid september i went to guanggho alone  i was looking for an accomodation in the evening and after having walked  or  miles i still could not find anything  what could i do  i was not worried about sleeping on the streets but because of some procedural problems  i finally found a place to sleep at  oclock i had taken the responsibility to do something and i had prepared for it  however i failed because of my timidity  after three attempts i still could not adapt to the atmosphere and failed as before  i felt imcompetent and felt that the others would think that i had not prepared for it

              " [' when i realized that i was directing the feelings of discontent with myself at my partner and this way was trying to put the blame on him instead of sorting out my own feeliings when i was tired and unmotivated i shouted at my girlfriend and and brought up negative sides of her character which are actually not so important when one has been unjust stupid towards someone else   when i saw my  year old son grab an oxygen mask as he had breathing difficulties  i had a bad conscience because i had not stopped smoking  medication for the dilation of his breathing tubes also caused a sense of guilt in me when as an adult i have been caught lying or behaving badly i lied to be precise i cancelled a meeting with a good friend my elder brother and i have not always had a good relationship and i feel ashamed of myself as i do not call him to talk to him nowadays i told a friend that i was going to a party and he would not enjoy himself if he came along  he understood  that he would not have fitted in and there was something in that my friend was so intoxicated that the police came and took him away and they later contacted his parents when my friend and i were discussing the good looks of a guy we realized that he had been listening nearly caught masturbating when i dropped a bottle in the state liquor store and everyboby started laughing the discovery that one has only thought of oneself when i promised to help a friend over a weekend and did not keep the promise when my boyfriend revealed that he knew that i had discovered things of an important nature about him i felt ashamed as i had not mentioned it earlier when i had not prepared my contribution to the group as thoroughly as the other members with the result that the overall result was poor when i met a friend whom i had not seen for a long time and heard all about her troubles i thought that i should have got in touch with her earlier one night i had a sexual intercourse with another man  my sexual desire and my curiosity had made me jump into bed with him  i am ashamed of myself now my inability to assert myself positively in a group i guess i have often been ashamed after having talked badly of other people cant think of any none when we were at home my husband and i he made a remark about something i had done in a perfectly friendly manner  my deed had been unjust and i knew that my husband was right therefore my sense of shame once i arrived two hours late to my work place a bank and i was still feeling feeble and tired i was worried by a task related to my studies which had to be done in groups of two  i was talking about it to my friends when i said something negative in too abrupt a manner concerning my work partner  i did not quite mean what i said and i felt ashamed at having been mean enough to criticize him as he is also a friend of mine my little brother was arrested by the police at the railway station after he had drunk some beer after having quarelled unnecessarily and without any reason and having been stupidly cross in every way   when i overtook a car on the mainroad misjudging the distance of an oncoming car and this resulted in tooting and flashing from the other driver we could have collided and i had an acquaintance in the car with me when i forgot my mothers birthday     i drink wine too often i can not think of any incident when i have felt very ashamed  there are small incidents that i am ashamed of for instance not sending money to the children in ethiopia when i boxed my childs ears emptied a bucket of water in a hospital when i did not buy what i had promised to i complained about a colleagues behaviour as she goes back on her word is often absent and is irresponsible  i found out that she was an alcoholic and was trying to fight againt her addiction my mother revealed personal details about me and the negative aspects of my character to other people when i was present but unable to defend myself when i dated a close girlfriends boyfriend a few times he told me that it was over between them and i accepted it  when she found out she finished our friendship  at primary school when i vomited in front of others in the middle  of a lesson when i made the same mistake that i had accused someone else of and this was obvious to a third pereson when i was caught stealing money from my father when my mother caught me masturbating when i complained to my mother about how untidy the kitchen loooked she boxed my ears  this had never happened before when i asked a friend to return the money that i had loaned her and then remembered that she had repayed me in several ways when i forgot about a meeting at work when i as a child of  or  i was playing doctor with the neighbours boys their mother caught us spots on the seat covers of my husbands car confession to my parents about my involvement in a moped theft when i talked maliciously about a colleague at work to someone else  immediately afterwards i felt ashamed i made a comment and it was interpreted completely differently from what i had meant  when i said it i realized how my mother had understood it when i was a child it was found out that i had taken off my clothes outdoors  it was summer and my friend and i were out in the woods  it had felt exciting at that time  my parents discovered that my trousers were back to front and i felt ashamed when relatives have acted strangely and unfriendly towards me a customer at the shop where i worked came in and asked if the goods that he had ordered had arrived  i had totally forgotten about this order and i tried to offer weak excuses when i was an evening school teacher it was my job to make the coffee but i was not able to get the coffee ready on time and i thus arrived half an hour late to the class  on top of this the coffee was undrinkable when as an  year old i wet myself in school when i stole a packet of cigarettes from a neighbour  and the next day i owned up and returned it when i was  years old i wrote passionate love letters to my boyfriend and i later found out that his sister had read them about swedens arms exports when friends found out that i had been lying about where i had been on a particular occasion when i was young about  or  i did not make it to the toilet on time  i hid the dirty trousers in the cellar as i feared itbeing discovered by my parents on the

quite difficult i insulted a couple of good friends of mine and even tried to hit them when i was drunk  the next day i was ashamed of course i was wearing slippery shoes and i tumbled down in a place where there were many people walking by i lied to someone and some time later this person found out that i had not told him the truth i had lied to a person because i had thought that i could not tell him the truth when he found out he was not angry but understanding we talked the whole thing over quite recently i realized that i had had some erroneous views about life for instance i had always lived for other people had forgotten my own person and suppressed my own feelings i was ashamed because i had not been concious of that until i had a conversation about it with a person i was working in a job in which i could not work quickly enough and was told that my work was not up to standard when i got a bad result for one of my assignments at using other people because of sexual experience that was using another to the detriment of both anxiety that i may have affected another for the worst my mother told my uncle who is a roman catholic priest redemptist father that i had been living in a defacto relationship for three years he was very very angry at me     the day after the night i drank too much at a party     i do not remember when i last felf ashamed  i do not usually feel

acted unfairly i told my friend about how i had calculated my salary by cheating a little  when my friend remarked about it i understood that it was wrong to do so and i felt ashamed  sometimes i have

close to me beside me and i had no idea what to answer once when i said bad things concerning a friend i was alone in the bus when i tripped and fell and dropped all my papers when i fell head on in a fountain when a professor caught me absentminded and not paying attention to what he was saying the girl with whom i was going around had been forbidden to be alone with me in the house  we paid no attention to this prohibition but one day her parents appeared and i jumped out of the window  they saw me in a mathematics class the professor asked me a question and i gave the wrong answer once i had to visit a rather special person while shopping a person close to us created an uncomfortable situation for those who were with her a childrens film in which i played a clown with spotlights cameras and the director who demanded jumps and guffaws in class i had to say something aloud and people reacted  by laughing when i stated sharply something i was not very sure of and a few days later i was shown to be wrong a professor was going to read aloud in class a composition of mine in which i had criticized some political attitudes and also some classmates   i was ashamed at having written that this morning i spent a lot of time on my toilet and missed the train to the university  my mother told me that i spent more time than a woman on my toilet  i felt a mixed emotion of shame and anger when i was in a religious school my teacher showed me up in front of all my classmates  they were very sarcastic and cruel i slipped and fell in to a puddle and people started looking at me a person a male told me that he liked me  he has a problem he is a homosexual at a friends party there were several allusions to my sexual adventures when i was in the toilet and someone came in i was with a group of people and everybody told me to do or say something  it was a confusing strong and traumatic situation for me the parents of a friend of mine surprised us and another couple sleeping in thier place i was watching tv with my parents and some pornographic scenes came on i felt uncomfortable and tried to distract my parents attention by talking to them at a concert an old man arrived and began to danse sing and do silly things i was in a very small class and the professor said something about me that made everyone look at me at the same time in a very crowded shop i was distracted and missed my turn in the queue  a woman who was behind me began to shout at me asking me either to pay more attention or to leave i liked a boy and i would feel shy and then blush  the more i wanted to avoid it the more i blushed i was at the university dining room alone and at a table next to mine thre were several professors  one of them asked me to join them  i refused but she insisted  all the others started looking at me and i had to move to their table at the seaside when a wave suddenly came and took off my bikini at a meeting with over one hundred people they decided who had to speak from the stand by drawing lots when i went to my boyfriends house for lunch and saw his parents i felt that they were watching me all the time i was swimming in the river and i lost the top of my bikini  i did not notice it and came out of water  there was a disagreeable classmate watching the scene when i met a friend of mine after several months   i ride my motorbike in my village and everyone stares at me as if i was a rare specimen i greeted and embraced the wrong person thinking that it was my friend i feel this emotion very often when i try to express my feelings in public because other people do not understand my reactions and think that i am silly  i think that the only time i really felt shame was when i was very young and i had to defecate on the street  i was very worried in case someone should see me the mother of a friend of mine passed by me and saw me sitting on a boys lap  i tried to greet her but could not help blushing i was dancing in a theatre  i was not sure whether some frieends of mine had come to see me  i was very scared of doing things wrong when i entered a bar looking for a friend when the literature teacher made me recite a poem in the middle of the class and i had to gesticulate i was walking to school and i passed by a red cross post where there were many soldiers  they began to pass remarks at me when i was young i was told to to the shop to buy a dozen eggs  i went and asked for one egg and the people in the shop laughed at me and so did my family when i told them what had happened one day when i came back home i found my favourite dish broken  i blamed the servant for it later i found out that it was not the servant but my daughter who had broken it the time i shouted at most of my friends at a party  it was as if

loud voice something like we dont have cheaters in my class when i just took a shower with a girl down the hall i felt that i had let my devotion to god go out the window although nothig happened i

things about a man i had never seen  i was with a friend and did not know that she was related to this man  my friend did not tell me about it and i discovered this myself when my first sexual

my darling found me walking hand in hand with another girl whom i loved also  when i had to walk home from the busstop in a skirt that i had soiled  it drew a lot of attention and they all seemed to want to see the blood stains when i did something naughty and it lead to the embarrassment of my parents one morning after breakfast i was still not satisfied  my nephew a small boy of  had not eaten his breakfast and just when i was taking a bit of his share someone walked in when my sister became pregnant at unza last year when i contacted a sexually transmitted disease and the lecturer came to know about it as it was he who treated me for it when i failed the grade seven exams when my cousins wife refused him sex and claimed that she was my girllfriend  i think that there is something wrong

the professor and the professor entered the class right in the middle of it   i was unaware of her presence some of my friends tried to warn me but it was of no avail as i was too engrossed in mimicing  then i suddenly noticed the silence and turned around to see her entering the class  i do not know till today if she actually saw what i had been doing or she had completely ignored it  through  out that lecture i died of shame  all the more shameful was the fact that she gave me a character certificate  i was learning judo and my instructor wanted me to assist him in teaching girls judo at a suburban college  i was just a beginer and he made me a green belt so that i would be able to command respect  this was against my principles and yet i allowed myself to listen to him  i

the indian poulation is still below the poverty line i had this feeling before my graduation and never dared to speak to my relatives and  friends  because of this feeling i would avoid situations

could hardly think and did not know what to answer when i was in the canteen of the united college i mistook a stranger for a classmate as i was not wearing my glasses  i realized that i had made this mistake when i saw him again carefully my companion admired me when i did some work voluntarily when the teacher asked me a question i did not know the answer and i just stood still for about a few minutes without saying a word during the lesson the teacher called me and asked me if i had reported that i was late  i pretended that i had but looking at her eyes i knew that she knew that i was lying  i thought that it was really bad luck that she had examined the list of the students who were late while dining with some accquaintances i was asked something which i should have known but i did not know i saw a bag on the street and just then a stranger passed by  i picked up the bag immediately and gave it to the stranger as i thought that it belonged to him  but it was not his bag and i felt ashamed  during a lecture six students including me were asked to leave the class as we had not prepared for the lesson  i felt ashamed and angry our teacher had invited us to lunch and once at the canteen we started introducing ourselves  two of the boys showed a lot of interest in knowing personal details and then they started talking about some activities held in the college  i had little interest in those activities so i talked to another student sitting next to me as i was afraid that they would ask me questions on those activities acting in a play at the orientation camp made me feel timid when we received  our academic result i learnt that my  results were bad as i had not done my best  the results of my accquaintances were good and when they asked me about my results i really did not want to answer after i had given the wrong answer to my students they pointed it out to me and i had to correct myself when i was young my mother told the neighbour that i had wet the bed  i felt ashamed thinking that the neighbours children would get to know about it i had lunch in a restaurant with a friend and i paid the bill  the change was that of a two dollar and a ten cent coin  as i was talking with my friend i took the two dollar coin and forgot to leave a tip i received the results of the test paper of my major subject and i found that my result was not as good as a classmate who had recently changed his major subject    i felt very ashamed i lost my temper at my mother while she was teaching me  i felt ashamed and sorry at having hurt my loving mother during a meeting i said something wrong and the others laughed at me my teacher said that being university studets we did not have any selfinitiative or selfcontrol i promised a friend that i would return a book to its owner for him  but i forgot to do it when i was doing my homework at home some relatives came and advised me to help my mother do the housework during a meeting i could not finish my homework on time i had something wrong saying wrong things and being impolite to someone and this had embarrassed the this person  and i still meet the person once my presentation was the worst among my classmates as i had not prepared it well and had not seen it as important  my presentation was so confused that it clearly showed my poor preparation once in primary five i had forgotten to take a book to class and the teacher punished me by asking me to stand at the back of the class  i thought about the way my mother would react if she saw me being punished  my mother was very good to me and though she did not see me punished i felt sorry for her in a christian gatherings lucky draw i mistook a girls name for mine a boys name  i realized my mistake only when i went up to the stage for the prize  i did not know what to do as everyone was looking at me  i blushed and went back to my seat one day when i was sitting on the bus there was an old woman standing beside me  i was very tired and sleepy and did not think of giving her my seat  a  year old woman who was sitting beside me got up and gave her seat to the old woman and said   old woman please take my seat the youngstters these days are not used to giving their seats to others  when i heard these words i was very ashamed of myself and wanted to get off the bus at once   when i was emotionally unstable i said things which may have hurt others or made them feel unhappy  when i calmed down i realized that i had been selfish and had not taken into consideration the feelings of others  then i felt ashamed as someone pointed out my behaviour to me when i was young i felt ashamed when our relatives visited us and i hid myself one day i felt dizzy during a lecture  when the lecturer asked us as to who had heard the fairy tale  i was the only one who put up his hand and this surprised the whole class it was discovered that i had received a warning letter as my gpa was very low during an informal discussion i contributed a lot even though i had not spent much time studying  whenever someone said that someone was not paying attention or that he had too many other things to do or that the persoon was not trying his best i would feel ashamed on christmas eve i went to a classmates home with other classmates  the next morning when i came out of the toilet she said something and i did not understand what she was saying  when she pointed at my trousers i discovered that i had forgotten to zip them up  i rushed back to the toilet but by the time the others had guessed what had happened i felt shame when i found that i was almost last in the exam i misunderstood a girl and thought that she loved me  one day when i was talking to her her boyfriend appeared and i felt ashamed when i was in  i led my class to a riot  however the form master said that my conduct was good and asked me to tell him the names of those who had taken part in it   i replied that i did not know my guilty behaviour was found out by others one day i was the leader of the weekly meeting of the church fellowship  that day i had been preparing for the exams and did not estimate the time to travel to the church right and i was twenty minutes late  as i had not prepared well i led the meeting badly  i was ashamed of myself   during the english lesson we were required to do a play  a few days after doing it the teacher asked us to do it again at a meeting  and i forgot my part when i was in lower six i joined an interview group to interview the general public  one of my friends in the group lost her purse and she was very nervous  five of us had to go another place so we left her and planned to see her later  then i heard her describing how her purse looked  i realized that i had seen her purse on the floor and had not wanted to do any thing about it  a few days back i had a tutorial class and the teacher randomly assigned one person in each group to make a presentation  the discussion in our group had been confused and the presentation was not very well prepared  unfortunately i was selected to present and i could not keep calm was confused and result was very poor  i really felt ashamed my teacher reminded us not to do a summer job however i did it for two months  yesterday i was chatting with my teacher and when we talked of the summer job i felt ashamed one rainy day when the streets were wet and as i was walking down a slope i fell down out of my carelessness  there were many people and they saw me so i felt ashamesd  moreover i hurt my ankle and it was painful when i was in a bus on my way to the examination centre a man    sitting opposite me kept looking at me continously  i did not know  what was wrong  when i reached the  centre i started strolling around  as i still had a little time  suddenly a man came and whispered you  have forgotten to zip up your trousers  i was at a loss to say anything  and i felt very embarrassed  when i thought of the bus incident i felt  even more ashamed when i asked my classmate to teach me to do my homework he asked me to study by myself first but i did not do it  when he asked me  if i had studied i felt very ashamed  once a female classmate told me that the clothes i wore seemed to be a childs clothes  on hearing this i felt a little ashamed and i criticized her clothes though there was nothing wrong with them i forgot to zip up my trousers this was not noticed by anyone being unable to stop urinating on the bus my friend had many female friends and i thought that they were his lovers  i would scold him but he did not accept my advice  later i learnt from his girlfriends that this was not true  i felt ashamed at having misunderstood him last summer i went camping with some cu students  as i was working then i had to leave the second night some of them had joined us the first night  next morning  oclock a female classmate knocked on our door and tried to wake us up  i was not fully conscious and i said something which i should not have  i realized the trouble i had made and wanted to hide  later i said sorry to her and the matter came to an end i did not do the homework that the teacher had asked us to do  i was scolded imm'],\n",
